*10.0.1. Traffic Accident Map*

In the first exercise we built a form that allows a user to
download requested data. However, it would be difficult for a user to
gauge the coordinates needed for the download. ESRI Maps can be
incorporated so the user can select an area on the map they would like
to see.

This example allows a user to draw a point, line, or polygon using the
drawing tools from the ArcGIS JavaScript API. When the geometry has been
created on the map, it is then sent to a workspace as well known text (WKT).
The workspace will convert that geometry into GeoJSON and stream it back
to the web application.
