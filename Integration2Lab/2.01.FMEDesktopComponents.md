FME Desktop consists of a number of different tools and applications. The two key applications are **FME Workbench** and the **FME Data Inspector**.

## FME Workbench ##
FME Workbench is the primary tool for defining data translations and data transformations. It has an intuitive point-and-click graphic interface to enable translations to be graphically described as a flow of data.

Workbench is not a standalone tool. It is fully integrated to interact with other FME Desktop applications such as the FME Data Inspector.


## FME Data Inspector ##
The FME Data Inspector is a tool for viewing data in any of the FME supported formats. It is used primarily for previewing data before translation or reviewing it after translation.
