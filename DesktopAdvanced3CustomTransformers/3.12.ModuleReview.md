**Theory**

- A custom transformer is a sequence of standard transformers condensed into a single transformer.
- A custom transformer lets you tidy your workspace, re-use sequences of transformers, and apply some advanced functionality like looping.
- Handling schema in a custom transformer is very important, and it can be done either automatically or manually.
- Custom transformers can be either embedded or linked.
- Custom transformers can be used to implement parallel processing.
- Loops in FME can only be implemented in a custom transformer.

**FME Skills**
