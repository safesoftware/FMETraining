_Video covering adding transformers_

We now know from the last unit that we have missing values in our data. We can use a filtering transformer to remove features with missing values.

## 1) Add Tester Transformer

Click on the feature connection from reader to writer feature type:

IMAGE

Start to type the phrase "Tester." When the list is short enough for you to see the Tester, select it from the dialog (double-click on it):

IMAGE

Doing so will place an Tester transformer:

Notice that the Passed output port is the one connected by default.

## 2) Set Parameters

Inspect the parameters for the Tester transformer (either its dialog or in the Parameter Editor window). Click in the Left Value field and from there click the down arrow and choose Attribute Value > `Day`:

IMAGE

For the Operator field click the cell and select "Attribute Has a Value." We do not need to fill in the Right Value field for this operator.

IMAGE

Now, we know from inspecting the data that the missing values were entire empty rows. However, if you browse through the data again, you will notice that some attributes have scattered missing values. Let's guard against those coming to bother us in the future by removing features missing values in **any** attribute we might want to use.

To do this, we can copy the existing statement and change the attribute name. Click in the Left Value cell with `Day`. This action will select this row. Then click the Copy button located in the bottom left of the Test Clauses table:

This will copy this row to the clipboard. Next, click in the empty Left Value cell below and click the Paste button. This will duplicate the first row. Change the attribute value to `Department`. Repeat this procedure for the following attributes:

- `Hour`
- `Local_Area`
- `Minute`
- `Month`
- `Year`

Your Test Clauses table should look like this:

IMAGE

{% call template.tip() %}

This clipboard works across transformers, so keep it in mind if you ever need to perform a similar operation.

{% endcall %}

Click OK to accept the values and close the dialog.

## 3) Run the Workspace using Feature Caching

Now that you know how to use Feature Caching, we can use it to test our new transformer. Select the AttributeManager transformer. Then click the "Run To This" icon:

IMAGE

Your workspace will run. If you set up the Tester properly, it should do so without errors! If you pay attention while the translation is running, you can see the feature counts increasing as features flow through the workspace. Note that by the time the translation is complete, 20 features will be filtered out to the Tester's Failed port. These features had missing values and are removed from the rest of the translation.

## 4) Create a `Date` Attribute

We added a `Date` attribute to the writer feature type, but it is currently not being supplied with any values. We could use several different transformers to accomplish this; there are often many solutions to a problem in FME. For example, we could use the [ExpressionEvaluator](http://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/expressionevaluator.htm) or [StringConcatenator](http://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/stringconcatenator.htm). In this case, let's keep our workspace efficient by creating the attribute within the AttributeManager.

Open the AttributeManager Parameters by double-clicking it or clicking the cogwheel icon. Go to the bottom of the Attribute Actions table and notice the last row is empty except for the text `<Add new Attribute>`. Click this text and type in `Date`. You might notice it appears as an option in the drop-down menu; FME will look ahead to your writer schema to help you find attributes like this. After you type in date, the Action cell changes to `Set Value`:

IMAGE

We can enter in the value for our `Date` attribute in the Attribute Value column. If we were to simply type in "January 1st, 2000," all of the features would receive that value. However, what we want to do is create a date attribute that combines (or "concatenates") our existing date-time fields: `Year`, `Month`, `Day`, `Hour`, and `Minute`.

We can do that using FME's Text Editor, which allows us to construct an expression to generate the value for our attribute. To open it, click the Attribute Value cell, and then click the drop-down arrow that appears. You will see "Open Text Editor" and "Open Arithmetic Editor" as options. Click "Open Text Editor":

IMAGE

The text editor - as you would expect - allows you to construct a text value. It includes all the usual string-handling functionality you would need, such as concatenation, trimming, padding, and case changing.

The text editor looks like this:

![](./Images/Img4.016.AttributeManagerTextEdit.png)

Here the user is constructing an address string by concatenating various existing attributes with some fixed characters (the commas).

Notice the menu on the left-hand side. Existing attributes are listed here and were added into the string by double-clicking them. Also, notice the other menu options. Maybe the most important for text are the String Functions:

![](./Images/Img4.017.AttributeManagerTextEditStrings.png)

The Arithmetic Editor contains similar functions, as well as mathematical operators to calculate values for attributes.

Let's combine existing attributes to create a `Date` attribute. In the left-hand panel under "FME Feature Attributes" you will see all the incoming attributes listed. Double-click the attribute `Year`. Doing so adds `@Value(Year)` to the Text Editor window. When the translation is run, this code will take the value of `Year` for each feature. We can combine multiple attribute values together to construct the date. In this case we will create a [standard FME date/time stamp](https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Workbench/!Transformer_Parameters/standard_fme_date_time_format.htm), but you could use the Text Editor to format your date however you like.

Copy and paste the following code into the Text Editor:

```
@TimeZoneSet(@Format(%04d,@Value(Year))@Format(%02d,@Value(Month))@Format(%02d,@Value(Day))@Format(%02d,@Value(Hour))@Format(%02d,@Value(Minute))00, local)
```

Do not worry too much about the details here. In short, we are using the `@TimeZoneSet` function to add a [UTC offset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTC_offset) to each datetime stamp. We are forming the datetime stamp by combining the attributes from our source data into a string matching FME datetime format: `yyyymmddhhss-UTC`. Our original data had single digit months, days, hours, and minutes missing the leading zero, so we use the `@Format` function to fix that problem. This new attribute will be easier to use in FME workflows.

Once you have pasted the expression into the Text Editor, click OK and OK again. Then run the workspace.

{% call template.tip() %}

Many FME Text and Arithmetic Editor functions come from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tcl">Tcl programming language</a>. If you do not want to type out code, most results can also be accomplished using transformers. For more information, refer to the <a href="http://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Workbench/!Transformer_Parameters/text_editor.htm">Documentation</a>.

{% endcall %}

## 5) Inspect the Data

Inspect the output and examine the Table View window. You can see that the underscores have been removed from attribute names and the `Date` attribute now correctly displays the full date/time in FME standard format:

IMAGE

{% call template.congrats() %}

<ul>
  <li>Filter data using the Tester transformer</li>
  <li>Use transformer parameters to create attributes that match the writer schema</li>
  <li>Construct an attribute value using the Text Editor</li>
</ul>

{% endcall %}
