<h2 id="determine-schema-mapping-goals">Determine Schema Mapping Goals</h2>
<p>Now that Jennifer has created a&nbsp;<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData/Workspaces/IntegrateDataWithTheFMEPlatform/map-datas-schema.fmw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workspace</a>&nbsp;that edits the PostGIS data&rsquo;s schema, she has to map it, telling FME how the original and new schemas are related.</p>
<p>She opens the workspace in FME Workbench (2023.0 or later) and notices the triangle icon on her writer feature type has turned red.</p>
<p><img src="images/1690321177294.png" alt="Red input port" /></p>
<p>She clicks the triangle to expand the list of attributes entering the feature type.</p>
<p><img src="images/1690321229013.png" alt="Expanded feature type attributes with red port" /></p>
<p>FME uses colored ports to indicate the status of schema mapping. In this case, the red port means an attribute exists on the writer feature type but not on the features entering the feature type. An attribute with a red port will not cause an error when the workspace is run, but it will not have any values in the written data.</p>
<p>To ensure her new&nbsp;<strong>first_name&nbsp;</strong>attribute gets the same values as her existing&nbsp;<strong>first&nbsp;</strong>attribute, we must map the new schema onto the old one. We can use the AttributeManager transformer for that.</p>

<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Yellow <span style="color: #e8e058;">▶</span>: this reader feature type attribute is not mapped to any writer feature type; therefore, this attribute will not be in the output.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Red <span style="color: #b80909;">▶</span>: this writer feature type attribute is not connected. While it exists in the schema, it will not receive any data and, therefore, will not have any values in the written data.</span></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="add-an-attribute-manager">Add an AttributeManager</h2>
<p>Jennifer clicks the black<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-Form/Workbench/Including_Transformers_in_a_Workspace.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feature connection line</a>&nbsp;</strong>between the reader feature type and the&nbsp;<strong>GeometryFilter&nbsp;</strong>to select it. She observes the light blue highlight indicating the line is selected.</p>
<p><img src="images/1690321451904.png" alt="Selected feature connection line" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Feature connection line</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">: these lines connect feature types and transformers on the canvas and control the flow of features from left to right.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When any object on the canvas is selected, using Quick Add will automatically connect the new object. With the feature connection line selected, Jennifer types in &ldquo;AttributeManager.&rdquo; The Quick Add dialog appears, letting her search for transformers, readers, and writers. She finds the AttributeManager and presses Enter to add it.</p>

<p>The AttributeManager appears on the canvas. Jennifer double-clicks it to open its&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-Form/!Transformer_Parameters/transformer_parameters.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Parameters dialog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="map-schema-with-an-attribute-manager">Map Schema with an AttributeManager</h2>
<p>The&nbsp;<strong>AttributeManager&nbsp;</strong>parameters are a table that defines how to modify attributes. It allows you to create new attributes, edit existing attribute names, change their order, and set their values.</p>
<p>Jennifer plans to use this transformer to change incoming features so their schema matches the writer feature type.</p>
<p>First, she clicks in the<strong>&nbsp;Output Attribute</strong> column for the first attribute and renames it &ldquo;first_name.&rdquo; Then she clicks the&nbsp;<strong>Move Down&nbsp;</strong>button to change the attribute order. Then she Shift + clicks the&nbsp;<strong>latitude&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>longitude&nbsp;</strong>attribute rows and clicks the&nbsp;<strong>Remove Row&nbsp;</strong>button&nbsp;to delete them. Her dialog looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/1690324145294.png" alt="Setting AttributeManager parameters" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p>⭐&nbsp;<strong>New for FME 2023.0:&nbsp;</strong>the AttributeManager can now change attribute types.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>She clicks&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>. Now the attribute ports on the writer feature type all turn green, showing her schema is mapped.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1652133120123.png" alt="Schema is mapped" /></p>
<p>However, Jennifer notices a slight problem:&nbsp;<strong>BusinessOwners&nbsp;</strong>looks good, but&nbsp;<strong>BusinessOwners_incomplete&nbsp;</strong>still has its original schema. How can she quickly update the schema to match the incoming features?</p>
<p>Jennifer knows she can use&nbsp;<strong>Automatic Attribute Definition</strong>&nbsp;mode for this task. She double-clicks on&nbsp;<strong>BusinessOwners_incomplete&nbsp;</strong>and then clicks the<strong>&nbsp;User Attributes</strong>&nbsp;tab. The first section of this dialog is&nbsp;<strong>Attribute Definition</strong>.</p>
<p>There are three attribute definition modes for writer feature types. You can set these when adding a writer or after in the writer feature type parameters. They each have pros and cons depending on your needs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manual </strong>mode lets you define the schema. It's the default mode. When adding a writer, you can choose the default feature type definition mode<strong> Copy from Reader</strong>. That mode copies the schema from one or more reader feature types to the writer feature types. It then sets the writer feature types' attribute definition mode to <strong>Manual</strong>, so you can edit them as we have been doing. Writer feature types will also be set to <strong>Manual </strong>if you choose the feature type definition mode <strong>Manual</strong>. In that case, you must specify the entire schema yourself from scratch.
<ul>
<li>Choose <strong>Manual </strong>mode if you are defining a new schema and want to be able to ensure all incoming features meet its requirements. Don't forget to check for red ports that indicate your schema is not mapped correctly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Automatic </strong>mode will tell the feature type to adopt the schema of whatever features are connected to it. It looks empty until it is connected to a stream of data. Then it adopts the incoming schema. FME sometimes has to guess the data types, so you should check them before writing. You can always use <strong>Automatic </strong>to set the schema, then change to <strong>Manual </strong>to edit it.
<ul>
<li>Choose <strong>Automatic </strong>mode if you want to create the writer schema from incoming features quickly. The one catch is that it might not choose the exact correct attribute data type, so don't forget to check those.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_ReadersWriters/!FeatureTypeProperties/workspaces_dynamic_about.htm" target="_self"><strong>Dynamic </strong>mode</a> is an advanced option that tells the feature type to write whatever schema it receives at run-time. Unlike all the other modes, this schema does not have to be defined at authoring time. You can learn more about dynamic writing in the <a href="https://academy.safe.com/path/advanced-reading-and-writing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advanced Reading and Writing learning path</a>.
<ul>
<li>Choose <strong>Dynamic </strong>mode if you need to write out data and do not know the schema in advance or expect it to change over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p>You get a few more feature type definition options when adding a writer.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Why didn&rsquo;t Jennifer use Automatic mode first if it was so easy? Well, she had first to edit the schema upstream using the <strong>AttributeManager</strong>. As the data flows from the reader feature type, it gets edited in the&nbsp;<strong>AttributeManager</strong>. When set to <strong>Automatic </strong>mode, these changes will be reflected automatically in the writer feature type. If she left it on&nbsp;<strong>Manual</strong>, she would have to repeat the edits on the writer feature type.</p>
<p>Jennifer clicks&nbsp;<strong>Automatic, </strong>and the schema changes to match the incoming features.</p>
<p><img src="images/1690325700811.png" alt="Choosing Automatic attribute definition mode" /></p>
<p>If she then wants to make changes, she could click&nbsp;<strong>Manual&nbsp;</strong>again. She leaves it in&nbsp;<strong>Automatic&nbsp;</strong>mode and clicks&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>. Then she clicks&nbsp;<strong>Run</strong>.</p>
