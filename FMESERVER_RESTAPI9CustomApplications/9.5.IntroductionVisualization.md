### 9.5 Data Visualization using ArcGIS Map

![](./Images/9.5.1.DataLoading.png)

In this example, we will create a map using an Esri basemap and use the
Esri JavaScript functions. In this example when a box is checked the a
KML layer is loaded. When the box is unchecked, then the layer will be
invisible. This is a great example of streaming real-time data to a map.
While parks and Skytrain stations may not be updated frequently, this
demo may be applied to real-time data. For more information on the Esri
JavaScript, please refer to the [ArcGIS Developers](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/intro-layers/index.html) Documentation.
