<p>Every journey starts with a single step—and so does every Learning Path. You’ve already taken the first step of your data integration learning journey by joining the FME Academy.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a new user, a seasoned data integration professional, or someone who loves to learn, there’s something in the FME Academy for you.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">
  <span>How Does It Work?</span>
</h2>
<p>In the FME Academy, learning topics are organized into <strong>courses</strong>, which are broken up into <strong>lessons</strong>. To finish a lesson, you earn points by completing a quiz. A quiz checks your knowledge with multiple-choice questions. Once you’ve finished all of the lessons in a course, you get a shiny new badge for your profile.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Paths</strong> are groups of courses that provide guided learning paths suited to specific roles or needs. You can also blaze your own Learning Path, and choose the courses that you’re most interested in without following a pre-existing Learning Path.</p>
<p>Let us be your Learning Path guide, and work through the rest of this course to learn the ins and outs of using the FME Academy.</p>
<h2 id="who-is-the-fme-academy-for">
  <span>Who is the FME Academy For?</span>
</h2>
<p>The short answer is, well, everyone. We are working on content for every role and every level of experience. The FME Academy focuses on FME platform product functionality, plus some experiments in scenario-based training content. The next lesson has information on other FME learning resources.</p>
<p>FME Academy blends a variety of content types and approaches to cater to all types of learners, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Videos</li>
  <li>Screenshots</li>
  <li>Images</li>
  <li>Tables and charts</li>
  <li>Step-by-step instructions</li>
  <li>Hands-on FME exercises</li>
</ul>
<p>When we create content, we use a set of guiding principles that include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Practical examples and scenarios</li>
  <li>Storytelling</li>
  <li>Casual voice and tone</li>
  <li>Positivity</li>
  <li>Fun!</li>
</ul>
<p>And did we mention fun? We want you—and everyone who uses the FME Academy—to have fun. We gamify our content so that you can learn new skills while you earn points and badges, and have something to show for it at the end.</p>
<h2 id="whats-a-certification">
  <span>What’s a Certification?</span>
</h2>
<p>The FME Academy is a great place to learn new FME skills. Once you've acquired enough FME experience, you can apply for an FME certification. Being certified offers a number of benefits, including:</p>

<h2 id="where-do-i-start">
  <span>Where Do I Start?</span>
</h2>
<p>First things first: To complete challenges, earn badges, and keep track of your progress, you need to log in to your account. If you are reading this right now, you’ve already succeeded, so now you’re ready to start learning and earning!  </p>
<h2 id="whats-a-quiz">
  <span>What’s a Quiz?</span>
</h2>
<p>Learning is the bread and butter of the FME Academy, and one of the best ways to learn is by doing. Earning a badge is more than just reading through courses. You also have to complete a multiple-choice quiz at the end of each lesson. If you pass the first time, you are awarded the full points. Passing after that earns you fewer points on a sliding scale.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">
  <span>What’s Next?</span>
</h2>
<p>You’ve logged in to the FME Academy and you’re ready to learn. You’re staring into a near-limitless expanse of learning opportunities, and it’s easy to be overwhelmed by the possibilities.</p>
<p>In the next lesson, you’ll learn how to navigate your way around and discover the content that’s right for you.</p>
