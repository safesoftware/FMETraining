<p>After completing this lesson, you’ll be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Navigate lessons, courses, and Learning Paths.</li>
  <li>Explain how you earn points, badges, and ranks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-a-trail">
  <span>What’s a Learning Path?</span>
</h2>
<p>A <strong>Learning Path</strong> is an ordered group of courses that provides a guided learning path to learning a new skill, product, or role.</p>
<p>A <strong>course</strong> covers a single learning topic. While Learning Paths are great for learning a comprehensive set of related topics, you can also mix and match courses freely. Say that you’re an FME user with five years of experience. It’s not worth your time to work through the <a href="https://safe.my.trailhead.com/en/content/safe/trails/integrate-your-data-with-the-fme-platform" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Integrate Your Data with the FME Platform</a> beginner Learning Path—you know most of that stuff already. Instead, you can pick and choose the courses that address the gaps in your knowledge or to help you grow your career in other ways.</p>
<p>A course is broken down into <strong>lessons</strong>. Each lesson covers a subtopic within a course and has a quiz at the end. When you ace the quiz, you get a healthy dose of points that add to the total displayed on your profile. When you’ve completed all of the lessons in a course, you earn a new badge.</p>
<p><img src="images/1611350019003.png" class="image image-block" alt="Figure illustrating Learning Path, course, and lesson hierarchy" /></p>
<p>When you earn points and badges, you advance ranks. When you begin you’re a Scout, and once you’ve earned your first badge you’re a Hiker. Eventually, you could even be an Adventurer (10 badges and 9,000 points).</p>
<h2 id="whats-an-exercise">
  <span>What’s an Exercise?</span>
</h2>
<p>Many lessons include an interactive FME exercise. A <strong>Resources</strong> section will provide you with links to interactive tutorials and starting workspaces when necessary.</p>
<p>Most FME Academy courses assume you have access to FME Desktop and FME Server. You can follow along with the step-by-step instructions using your own copy of FME. Many quizzes will ask questions that require you to work through the exercise.</p>
<p>If you need access to FME, you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sign up for a <a href="https://www.safe.com/free-fme-licenses/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">free trial</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://demos-safe-software.fmecloud.com/fmeserver/apps/FMEAcademyLab" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Use a virtual machine to gain temporary access to FME</a></li>
  <li>Ask your administrator for a license</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.safe.com/pricing/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Purchase FME</a></li>
</ul>

  <span>Mix Things Up with Trailmix</span>
</h2>
<p>There is a lot of learning material available for FME, and it’s organized in different ways. That’s why we give you a way to group courses and other content together and share them on your own terms. Did you ever make a mixtape or a music playlist? A trailmix is like a mixtape, but of courses, Learning Paths, and other external content instead of songs. You can keep a trailmix to yourself, or share it with anyone. Use a trailmix to set your own goals, or use it to onboard new employees by giving them a list of content to work through.</p>
<p>To create a trailmix, hover over the <strong>Learn </strong>tab, click <strong>Trailmixes</strong>, then click <strong>Create a trailmix</strong>. Give your trailmix a name, description, and custom URL, then click <strong>Next</strong>. From there, you can add whatever content you wish. Click <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/trailhead_basics/find-your-way-around-trailhead/images/1f398b4178209ba60c39c1b05115d6b0_cj-8-p-2-vzcv-00640-o-8-kd-060307-h.png" width="20" height="20" alt="The plus icon." class="image" /> on any course, Learning Path, project, or superbadge to add it to your trailmix. Once you’ve created a mix to your liking, share it with anyone you’d like by sending them the unique URL.</p>

  <span>Find What You’re Looking for with Search and Filters</span>
</h2>
<p>We want to make it easy to find what you’re looking for in the Academy. Use the search bar at the top of the screen to look for something specific, or you can filter courses and Learning Paths by feature area, product, role, or level. You can sort search results on the results page by clicking the Sort dropdown, which defaults to <strong>Most Relevant</strong>. If, for example, you're short on time, you can sort by quickest to complete. If you're getting close to that next rank, maybe you want to sort results by most points.</p>
<p><img src="images/1608162967006.png" class="image image-block" alt="Search results" /></p>
<p>To filter, view the full list of courses and click a role, level, product, or tag at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>You can choose as many filters as you want. If you don’t see what you’re looking for and want to start over, click<strong> Clear filters</strong>.</p>
