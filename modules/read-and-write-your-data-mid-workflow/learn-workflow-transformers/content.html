<ul>
  <li>Know when to use workflow transformers that let you read and write FME formats.</li>
  <li>Know when to use workflow transformers that let you read and write web services.</li>

  <span>Workflow Transformers</span>
</h2>
<p>Although data is usually read and written using readers and writers, it is possible to use transformers to do the same tasks. These transformers appear in the Workflows category of the Transformer Gallery, along with transformers capable of handling data in web services.</p>

  <span>Key Workflow Transformers</span>
</h2>
<p>Some of the key workflow transformers, and the tasks that they carry out, are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Read and Write FME Formats<ul>
      <li><a href="http://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/featurereader.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">FeatureReader</a>, <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/featurewriter.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">FeatureWriter</a></li>
      <li>These transformers let you read or write data in the middle of a workflow. The <a href="http://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/featurereader.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">FeatureReader</a> also lets you use input features in a spatial filter to control which features are read.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Read and Write Web Services<ul>
      <li><a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/dropboxconnector.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">DropboxConnector</a>, <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/googledriveconnector.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">GoogleDriveConnector</a>, <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/salesforceconnector.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">SalesforceConnector</a>, <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/slackconnector.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">SlackConnector</a>, and many more</li>
      <li>These transformers let you upload, download, and otherwise interact with web services.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Read and Write Attributes<ul>
      <li><a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/attributefilereader.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AttributeFileReader</a>, <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/attributefilewriter.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AttributeFileWriter</a></li>
      <li>The <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/attributefilereader.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AttributeFileReader</a> lets you read the contents of a file to an attribute, either as plain text or a binary blob. The <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/attributefilewriter.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">AttributeFileWriter</a> lets you write the contents of an attribute to a file.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Receive/Send Data Packets<ul>
      <li><a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/jmssender.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">JMSSender</a>/<a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/jmsreceiver.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Receiver</a>, <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/sqssender.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">SQSSender</a>/<a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/sqsreceiver.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Receiver</a>, <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/tcpipsender.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">TCPIPSender</a>/<a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Transformers/Transformers/tcpipreceiver.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Receiver</a></li>
      <li>These transformers let you send and receive messages using a variety of protocols.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>These transformers are part of a workflow because they don't necessarily read or write data at the start or end of a translation; they can be set up to read or write data mid-translation. This provides certain advantages over fixed-position readers and writers.</p>
