  <span>Introduction</span>
</h2>
<p>In this unit, you’ll create an Automation that will trigger two parallel workflows with different processing times, wait for both to complete, then proceed as one unified process. This type of workflow may be of particular interest when, for example, updating several feature types in a database. Instead of one large job submitted to one FME engine, enjoy the performance gains of splitting your workflow into separate jobs to be processed by many engines in parallel! Separating workflows into several smaller jobs, rather than one large one, can also increase fault tolerance (if one job fails, other parts of the operation can continue).</p>
<p>With Automations, many workspaces may be chained together to run in series (and/or parallel) after a triggering event. Merge Actions are available that will cause an Automation to wait until all jobs upstream of the Merge point have been completed, as long as they were triggered by the same event. New to FME Server 2021.1, Split-Merge Blocks make an Automation wait until all jobs contained within a block are complete.  When complete, a single, unified message (per input) is returned from the Split-Merge Block. We’ll take a look at how this works later. Provided more than one engine is available to FME Server, multiple jobs can be processed at once, increasing the speed of the Automation. These components are particularly useful when an output requires many data processing steps, but not all of the jobs need to run in series.</p>
<p>In this unit, there are five workspaces; we will coordinate their running to produce a (fictional) final data product. The sample workspaces contain Decelerator transformers in order to demonstrate how an Automation would handle different job timing in a production workflow.</p>

            <p>The example workspaces included here are purely illustrative – they don't really carry out any data integration. However, the Automation design follows a common pattern: process data on a schedule in parallel, conduct some post-processing, validate, and load. It would fit a workflow such as conducting a nightly database backup.</p>

<p>On the Automations canvas, double-click the Trigger node. In this exercise, configure an FME Server Schedule (initiated) Trigger on a daily interval. Once the Automation is running, we’ll be able to test it manually whenever we want. Alternatively, you can add a Manual Trigger to the canvas.</p>

<h2 id="8-should-i-use-the-merge-action-or-a-split-merge-block">
  <span>8) Should I use the Merge Action or a Split-Merge Block?</span>
</h2>
<p>What’s the difference between the Merge Action and Split-Merge Block? The main advantages of the Split-Merge Block are that it can merge Automations Writer outputs and wait for all triggered jobs within the block to finish before continuing with downstream actions. Right now, Split-Merge Blocks are limited to just workspace actions. In contrast, the Merge Action cannot be connected to multiple triggers or workflows that use Automations Writer messages.</p>
<p>When should you use the Split-Merge Block?  Consider the following scenario...</p>
<p>You would like to process statistics for each city block, in each county, of a state. You only want to process one summary report per county, but there are 60 counties containing 15 blocks, each representing a single feature. If a workspace runs for every feature, this will result in more reports being created than required. Specifically, the county-processing workspace (ProcessCounty.fmw) will run 60 times and the block-processing workspace (ProcessBlock.fmw) will run 900 times! </p>
<p>With a Split-Merge Block, all 900 block-level jobs will run before outputting a merged message for each county. This reduces the output messages to 60 (one for each county), and downstream workspaces can process the reports according to this message data. This workflow is impossible with the Merge Action because it uses Automations Writers.</p>
<p><img src="images/1657153881538.png" class="image image-block image-center" alt="Single Split-Merge block" /></p>
<p>Nested blocks are also supported for further message merging. If we reimagine the previous example to receive an email notification when the Automation completes, we can add another Split-Merge Block that surrounds all the workspaces. The output from the block would be 1 message since the Trigger initiates the workflow with 1 message, and this single message can be used to send an email.</p>
<p><img src="images/1657153911130.png" class="image image-block image-center" alt="Nested Split-Merge blocks" /></p>
<p>The Split-Merge Block opens new doors for handling Automations Writer outputs, allows control over the granularity of message merging for downstream processes, and can drastically improve the efficiency of your workflows when combined with Queue Control.

<p>Downstream of the Merge, configure a Run Workspace Action to run Validation.fmw. Now that all the planned updates to the database are prepared, it is time for a validation routine before the changes are reconciled and posted. Downstream of the success port of the Action that runs the data validation workspace, configure a Run Workspace to run MakeDataProduct.fmw. Imagine that you’re now set up to generate a nightly report that will be ready in the morning with the previous day’s work incorporated!</p>

<p>To get an email with the job log of any other failed jobs, connect the failure ports of those jobs to the email Action as well (or add another Email Action). Since the workspaces included in this exercise will not fail jobs, test that emails will be sent by also connecting the Email Action to the success port of your validation Action.</p>
