  <span>Running a Workspace on the Web</span>
</h2>
<p>Frank is ready to test his self-serve <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData/Workspaces/IntegrateDataWithTheFMEPlatform/publish-your-self-serve-workspace.fmw" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">workspace</a>. He clicks the link from the <strong>Translation Log </strong>(http://localhost/fmeserver/#/workspaces/run/Self-Serve/CommunityMapping.fmw/) to open the workspace in FME Server (2022.0 or later).</p>
<p>He logs into FME Server and sees the <strong>Run Workspace </strong>page.</p>
<p><img src="images/1651858194735.png" class="image image-block image-center" alt="Run Workspace page" /></p>
<p>He leaves the default settings at the top part of the interface. He selects "Excel" from the <strong>Output Format </strong>drop-down. He wants a current extract of the <strong>FoodVendors </strong>table, so he looks at the <strong>Feature Types to Read </strong>Published Parameter. He clicks the drop-down and selects “FoodVendors” from the list. Then he clicks <strong>Run</strong> to request his data.</p>

<h2 id="receiving-the-results-of-a-data-download">
  <span>Receiving the Results of a Data Download</span>
</h2>
<p>Because he used the <strong>Data Download </strong>service, when the workspace finishes running, he is taken to a page with a link to a ZIP file of the results of the workspace. He clicks it to download.</p>
<p><img src="images/1651858229700.png" class="image image-block image-center" alt="Viewing Data Download URL" /></p>
<p>He finds the ZIP file in his local <strong>Downloads </strong>folder and extracts it. He has received the <strong>FoodVendors </strong>data as an Excel file called <strong>Training.xlsx</strong>. Now he can send the self-serve link to any end-user and they can download their desired data.</p>

<p>Fatima is one of Jennifer and Frank’s colleagues. She works as a Business Data Analyst at the city’s Business License Office. She often needs to add data to the <strong>FoodVendors </strong>feature class when she is out of the office doing business license inspections. Frank sets up <a href="https://www.safe.com/fme/mobile/fme-data-express/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">FME Data Express</a> on her tablet (available on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.safe.fmeexpress" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Android</a> or <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/fme-data-express/id1457168318" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">iOS</a>) so she is able to access FME Server on-the-go. Using FME Data Express, she can run a different workspace designed for data submission, which will automatically read her GPS coordinates and use them to create a point feature.</p>
<p>FME Data Express lets mobile users run any workspace published to FME Server, letting them get access or create data on the go. It can also allow users to share their location or upload images directly from their device camera. This app unlocks powerful mobile data integration workflows and saves vital time for users back at the office.</p>
