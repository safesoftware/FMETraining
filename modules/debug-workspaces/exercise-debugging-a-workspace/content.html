  <span>Exercise</span>
</h2>
<p>Your manager just assigned you to take over a project from your colleague, and they passed their workspace on to you. This project is to calculate the "walkability" of each address in the city of Vancouver. Walkability is a measure of how easy it is to access local facilities on foot. The workspace will measure the distance to the nearest park, the amount of crime in an area, and other similar metrics.</p>
<p>The workspace currently assesses crime, parks, and noise-control areas, but it doesn't give an overall measure of walkability.</p>
<p>Let's build on their workspace and use our debugging skills to address any problems we encounter.</p>
<h2 id="1-view-starting-workspace">
  <span>1) View Starting Workspace</span>
</h2>
<p>Start FME Workbench (2022.0 or later) and open the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData/Workspaces/UseDataIntegrationBestPractices/exercise-debugging-a-workspace.fmw" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">starting workspace</a>. Then run the workspace to cache the data.</p>
<p>This workspace is a bit messy, but you can fix that in a <a href="https://safe.my.trailhead.com/content/safe/modules/document-your-workspace/exercise-improving-workspace-style?trail_id=fme-desktop-basic" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">different exercise</a>. </p>
<p>First, let's figure out what this workspace does:</p>
<p><img src="images/74-ec-17-d-4-4577-431-d-8-f-9-a-01712-e-6-f-84-f-6.png" class="image image-block image-center" alt="Sections of starting workspace" /></p>
<ol>
  <li>Reading Addresses.gdb creates PostalAddress and PostcodeBoundaries feature types.</li>
  <li>Transformers clean attributes from the PostalAddress feature type and create a separate Number and Street attribute. Then the last two digits of the Number are being replaced by XX to create an attribute that will be the Join Key for joining the crime data.</li>
  <li>Reading crime.csv creates the Crime feature type. Substituting XX for the last two digits anonymizes the street number for each crime incident.</li>
  <li>The FeatureJoiner joins PostalAddress and Crime based on the Join Key attribute created in 2 and the Block attribute from Crime.</li>
  <li>Transformers set the crime Type attribute to a number based on severity and then calculate the total CrimeValue for each address block. The CenterPointReplacer ensures only one point exists if there are multiple crime incidents in the same location.</li>
  <li>Reading Parks.tab creates the Parks feature type. This data will let us measure the walking distance from addresses to parks.</li>
  <li>Using the NeighborFinder, the park closest to each address is determined.</li>
  <li>The NeighborFinder creates the _distance attribute. The AttributeRenamer renames it to ParkDistance.</li>
  <li>The Creator and FeatureReader are used to read the Planning Restrictions OGC Geopackage. Then from that dataset, the NoiseControlAreas feature type is used to obtain the noise restriction areas.</li>
  <li>The PointOnAreaOverlayer joins the point data containing the crime, distance to park, and addresses with the NoiseControlAreas polygons. The merged data assigns the noise restrictions to any overlapping points. The AttributeValueMapper creates the attribute NoiseZoneScore, giving a score to each point based on its zone. This new attribute reflects that addresses in noise-restricted areas are more walkable.</li>
</ol>

  <span>2) Tidy Starting Workspace</span>
</h2>
<p>This workspace is very messy as our colleague didn't follow any best practices. Follow the instructions in the <a href="https://safe.my.trailhead.com/content/safe/modules/document-your-workspace?trail_id=fme-desktop-basic" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Document Your Workspace</a> course to organize it, or click on the <strong>Autolayout</strong> button to quickly tidy it up:</p>
<p><img alt="Autolayout button" src="images/69-fda-8-a-6-e-5-d-7-4-c-6-e-a-1-ef-acba-814-b-8543.png" width="353" height="74" class="image image-block image-center" /></p>
<p>Note that this will change how your workspace looks compared to the instructions, so pay attention to the transformer names and ports:</p>

<h2 id="3-add-an-expression-evaluator-transformer">
  <span>3) Add an ExpressionEvaluator Transformer</span>
</h2>
<p>We can create a measure of walkability that combines all of our current values using the ExpressionEvaluator transformer.</p>
<p>So add an ExpressionEvaluator transformer to the end of the workspace and connect it to the AttributeValueMapper_2.</p>
<p>Inspect its parameters. Set it up to create a new attribute called Walkability that is:</p>
<div><pre>@Value(ParkDistance) + @Value(CrimeValue) - @Value(NoiseZoneScore)</pre>
</div>
<p><img src="images/7-a-1947-d-1-2874-485-e-af-88-9703808-d-2-fba.png" width="598" height="301" class="image image-block image-center" alt="ExpressionEvaluator expression" /></p>
<p>With this expression, the smaller the result, the better. Run the workspace. Because we ran the workspace and already have caches, only the ExpressionEvaluator will run.</p>
<h2 id="4-assess-the-result">
  <span>4) Assess the Result</span>
</h2>
<p>Let's assess whether the result of the translation is correct.</p>
<p>Firstly check the log window for errors and warnings. There are no errors, but there are several warnings, which is not a good sign:</p>
<p><img src="images/1652475763878.png" class="image image-block image-center" alt="Many warnings" /></p>
<div class="box message info">
  <div class="inner">
    <div class="bd">
      <div class="media">
        <img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="https://safemytrailhead.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" />
        <div class="mediaBd">
          <div class="message-media-content">
            <p>The number of warnings showed in the Translation Log may be different in your workspace. These numbers can vary based on the Logging Parameters set in FME Options.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>Click on the warnings button to filter out the warnings. The warnings say:</p>
<div><pre>ExpressionEvaluator: Failed to evaluate expression '@real64(560.3272250455418+&lt;null&gt;-0)'.
Result is set to null</pre>
</div>
<p>Inspect the output cache on the ExpressionEvaluator, and some addresses do indeed have a Walkability value of &lt;null&gt;.</p>
<p>So we know there is a problem, let's try and figure out where the problem is and why it occurs.</p>
<div class="box message info">
  <div class="inner">
    <div class="bd">
      <div class="media">
        <img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="https://safemytrailhead.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" />
        <div class="mediaBd">
          <div class="message-media-content">
            <p>A practical test would be to right-click on CrimeValue in the Table View window and sort by ascending numeric order. That will put any null values at the top of the table.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<h2 id="5-locate-the-problem">
  <span>5) Locate the Problem</span>
</h2>
<p>We can tell the warning comes from the ExpressionEvaluator, but that doesn't necessarily mean that is where the problem lies. The calculation fails because the middle value is &lt;null&gt;</p>
<p>If the expression is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>ParkDistance + CrimeValue - NoiseZoneScore</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then we know that it must be the CrimeValue that is an issue because it is the middle value. Let's find out where it becomes an issue. </p>
<p>First, organize the workspace a bit, and then inspect the caches on the FeatureJoiner transformer. We are inspecting the FeatureJoiner because that's where we first get our Crime data:</p>
<p><img src="images/5-eb-480-be-6941-45-a-6-be-81-759-b-625-ebd-5-f.png" class="image image-block image-center" alt="Viewing feature caches on the FeatureJoiner" /></p>
<p>There are no &lt;null&gt; values from the FeatureJoiner, so let's move along the translation. Check the cache for the AttributeValueMapper. This transformer sets values, so perhaps nulls are coming out of there?</p>
<p>If you inspect the AttributeValueMapper cache, you'll see no &lt;null&gt; values for the CrimeValue or the crime Type attribute. There are also no nulls for the Aggregator and CenterPointReplacer caches.</p>
<p>Checking each feature cache is a bit time-consuming; let's try a different method. Check the feature counts on each connection. There are 68,446 features tagged with a crime (FeatureJoiner:Joined), but then that is reduced to 9,899 after the Aggregator, and then there are 3,698 features without a crime (FeatureJoiner:UnjoinedLeft). That gives a total of 13,597, coming out of the NeighborFinder, which is correct.</p>
<p>For the 3,698 features that do not have a crime, what CrimeValue do they get? Inspect the UnjoinedLeft output from the FeatureJoiner, and you will see that they do not have the CrimeValue attribute. That's why the ExpressionEvaluator says that there are nulls. These features do not have a CrimeValue because they don't enter the AttributeValueMapper, which assigns the CrimeValue a value.</p>
<div class="box message info">
  <div class="inner">
    <div class="bd">
      <div class="media">
        <img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="https://safemytrailhead.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" />
        <div class="mediaBd">
          <div class="message-media-content">
            <p>To confirm this issue, I copied the log into a text editor and searched for the phrase "ExpressionEvaluator: Failed to evaluate expression."</p>
            <p>It appeared 3,698 times, the same as the number of features that exit the UnjoinedLeft port. Coincidence?</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<h2 id="6-fix-the-problem">
  <span>6) Fix the Problem</span>
</h2>
<p>If those features do not have a CrimeValue attribute, then we should give them one. To do so, add an AttributeCreator transformer to the workspace between the FeatureJoiner:UnjoinedLeft output port and the NeighborFinder:Base input port:</p>
<p><img src="images/7-e-04-d-532-3442-4-ebc-9-c-23-b-4-b-787092-b-77.png" class="image image-block image-center" alt="Adding an AttributeCreator" /></p>
<p>Open up its parameters and create an attribute called CrimeValue with a value of zero (0).</p>
<p><img src="images/54-e-4-a-961-e-7-ab-4-abf-9-a-82-95487-ffbad-0-e.png" width="451" height="152" class="image image-block image-center" alt="Adding the CrimeValue attribute with a value of 0" /></p>
<p>Run the workspace, which will run from the AttributeCreator to the ExpressionEvaluator. You should now find fewer warnings and that the output contains no &lt;null&gt; values.</p>
<h2 id="7-add-swimming-pools">
  <span>7) Add Swimming Pools</span>
</h2>
<p>The city has decided that parks are not a great candidate for walkability scores because there is usually a park nearby. They decided to evaluate how easy it is to walk to a swimming pool.</p>
<p>We can reuse the same workflow for swimming pools that we used for parks, with just a few minor updates.</p>
<p>First, let's add a new reader with the following parameters:</p>
<div>
  <table class="featureTable sort_table">
    <tbody class="tbody">
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Reader Format</p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>OpenStreetMap (OSM) XML</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>
          <p>Reader Dataset</p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData/Data/OpenStreetMap/leisure.osm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData/Data/OpenStreetMap/leisure.osm</a></p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
<p>When prompted, select only the leisure feature type:</p>
<p><img src="images/8-d-774-e-66-e-405-49-da-ad-36-668-d-9-fba-78-c-9.png" width="397" height="241" class="image image-block image-center" alt="Selecting the leisure feature type" /></p>
<p>Then move the new leisure reader near the Parks reader and connect it to the NeighborFinder:Candidate input port. Then right-click on the Parks reader and select disable.</p>
<h2 id="8-filter-leisure-data">
  <span>8) Filter Leisure Data</span>
</h2>
<p>If you inspect the leisure data, you'll notice various leisure facilities types, with the type recorded in the leisure attribute.</p>
<p>So, add a Tester transformer between the leisure reader and the NeighborFinder. Set up the parameters to test for leisure = swimming_pool</p>
<p><img src="images/2353-f-04-c-0101-4496-94-b-9-a-9-bd-18-e-12700.png" class="image image-block image-center" alt="Adding and configuring a Tester to filter to only swimming pools" /></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 id="9-update-transformer-parameters">
  <span>9) Update Transformer Parameters</span>
</h2>
<p>Now update AttributeRenamer to be PoolDistance instead of ParkDistance. The renaming of this attribute will cause the ExpressionEvaluator to turn red.</p>
<p>To fix the ExpressionEvaluator, open the parameters and change <code>@Value(ParkDistance)</code> to <code>@Value(PoolDistance)</code> to take account of the new PoolDistance attribute:</p>
<div><pre>@Value(PoolDistance) + @Value(CrimeValue) - @Value(NoiseZoneScore)</pre>
</div>
<p>Re-run the workspace. Check the log for warnings and errors, and then inspect the ExpressionEvaluator cache.</p>
<p>Notice that the walkability scores are exceedingly large all of a sudden due to the PoolDistance. Something is wrong, but what?</p>
<h2 id="10-locate-problem">
  <span>10) Locate Problem</span>
</h2>
<p>The PoolDistance is the source of the problem. There is no related log message to give a clue, and the Feature Count numbers look correct.</p>
<p>Let's inspect the data. Click on the leisure reader and while holding the shift key, click on the NeighborFinder. Then right-click on either object and select Inspect Cached Features. This step will open all the selected caches in Visual Preview.</p>
<p>Right-click in the Graphics view, go to Background Map, and ensure Background map off is selected. Visual Preview shows two specks of data, a long distance apart. This result is typical of a mismatch of coordinate systems.</p>
<p>Click on some features and select the Feature Information button. In this window, you will see that the primary data has a coordinate system of UTM83-10, while the leisure data from OSM has a coordinate system of LL84.</p>
<p>This disparity is why the "nearest" pool to each address is such a high distance.</p>
<h2 id="11-fix-coordinate-system-problem">
  <span>11) Fix Coordinate System Problem</span>
</h2>
<p>The obvious solution is to reproject the pools to the correct coordinate system. So, add a Reprojector transformer to reproject the leisure data before it gets to the NeighborFinder:</p>
<p><img src="images/50-b-55155-21-ae-423-b-b-0-b-8-c-63-fc-9711-faa.png" class="image image-block image-center" alt="Adding a Reprojector" /></p>
<p>Inspect its parameters and set it up to reproject from LL84 to UTM83-10.</p>
<p>Re-run the appropriate parts of the workspace. Check the log window and inspect the ExpressionEvaluator cache.</p>
<p>Each address now has a walkability score account for pools instead of parks, with a lower number being better and a higher number worse.</p>
<p>Congratulations on debugging this workspace.</p>
