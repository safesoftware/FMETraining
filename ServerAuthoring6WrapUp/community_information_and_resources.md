**FME Knowledge Center**

The FME Knowledge Center is our community web site - a one-stop shop for all community resources, plus tools for browsing documentation and downloads.

Here you will find a wealth of information; including tips, tricks, examples, and FAQs. There are sections on both FME Desktop and FME Server, with articles on topics from installation and licensing to the most advanced translation and transformation tasks.

**FME Community Answers**

FME community members post FME related messages and questions and share in answering other users’ questions. Top users are known as "heroes". Come and see how they can help with your FME projects!

**The FME Channel**

This FME YouTube channel is for those demos that can only be properly appreciated through a screencast or movie.
Besides this there are a host of explanatory and helpful movies, including recordings of most training and tutorials.
