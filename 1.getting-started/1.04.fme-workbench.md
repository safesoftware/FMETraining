{% import "../includes/templates.html" as template %}

{% call template.tip() %}

Feel free to follow along in Workbench during these informational sections if you wish. Alternatively, you can just complete the hands-on exercises in each unit, which will illustrate the concepts shown between exercises.

## Major Components of FME Workbench ##

The FME Workbench user interface has many major components:

### Canvas ###

The FME Workbench canvas is where to define a translation. It is the primary window within Workbench:

By default the workspace reads from left to right; data source on the left, transformation tools in the center, and data destination on the right. Connections between each item represent the flow of data and may branch in different directions, merge together, or both.

### Menu/Toolbar ###

The menu bar and toolbar contain many tools: for example, tools for navigating around the Workbench canvas, controlling administrative tasks, and adding or removing readers/writers:

The Navigator window is a structured list of parameters that represent and control all of the components of a translation:

The number of transformers (above, 484) will vary depending on the version of FME and any optional custom transformers installed:

### Translation Log ###

The translation log reports on translations and other actions. Information includes any warning or error messages, translation status, length of translation, and the number of features processed:
