# Workspaces as a Publisher #

When a workspace needs to send an outgoing notification it is literally a Publisher, publishing to a topic. This is set up simply by connecting the workspace to that topic.

Publishing notification messages from a workspace is useful for both sending messages containing content from the data being processed, and for reporting the status of a translation, such as whether it has run successfully or ended in a failure.

Workspaces can be set up to trigger topics in one of two ways:

- Registering with the topic when it is published
- Using a transformer inside the workspace
