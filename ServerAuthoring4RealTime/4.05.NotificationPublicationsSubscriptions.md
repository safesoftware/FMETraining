Although the actions may seem odd in regard to the name – Publications receive messages, Subscriptions send them – it is correct. The name refers to the Client, not the Server. So FME Server receives a Publication because the client is publishing it. Likewise, FME Server sends a Subscription because the client is subscribing to it.
