This next exercise demonstrates a typically work flow if you were to create a web application that were to run a translation and download a file that is created from the translation. First, you would upload a workspace to your FME Server using Workbench. Then, the user would be instructed to upload a file, this should go to a Shared Resource folder within the FME Server. After the user uploads a file, the application would run the workspace which would produce a file to a shared resource location. Then, the user would be able to download the file.

If you wish to retrieve the result dataset from a workspace through the
REST API, the best method is to write it to a shared resource location
that is accessible to the client. In this example we will make a
workspace, then run a call while changing the output to the Temporary
Repository. We will use a very basic workspace to test this out.

#### Create the Workspace

**1)  Open FME Workbench and start a blank workspace.**

**2) Add a Microsoft Excel reader, with the BusinessLicenses File.**

**3) Then add CSV writer to the workspace.**

It is okay to accept the default parameters.

**4) Set the Destination Folder.**

The next step is to identify the Published parameter of the destination dataset. It should be called DestDataset_CSV2. Under this parameter, set the destination to be, $(FME_SHAREDRESOURCE_TEMP)

**5) Set the Source Dataset**

We will upload the data using the API later. For now change the source dataset folder to:

    $(FME_SHAREDRESOURCE_DATA)/SharedResourceTest/BusinessLicenses.xlsx

**6) Set the Source Dataset to a Private Parameter**

This can be accomplished by going to the navigator panel and then right clicking on the parameter. Then select "Convert to Private Parameter".


**7) Publish to FME Server**

Click the publish to FME Server button.

 Select the FME Server Connection created previously. Click Next.

Set the Repository name to RESTTraining. Click Next.

Select the Job Submitter Service and publish the Workspace


#### Upload the Data Using the Resources call

**8) Enter the following URL and Headers into Postman**

    POST http://<yourServerHost>/fmerest/v3/resources/connections/FME_SHAREDRESOURCE_DATA/filesys/SharedResourceTest?createDirectories=true
    Content-Type: application/octect-stream
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Disposition: attachment; filename= "BusinessLicenses.xlsx"
    Authorization: fmetoken token= [INSERT TOKEN HERE]

  ![](./Images/image6.3.2.UploadRequest.png)
    *Image 6.3.2 File upload request*

**9) Switch to the Body Tab in Postman**

**10) Select Binary and Click Choose Files**
<br>
Find
C:\FMEData2018\Data\Planning\BusinessLicenses.xlsx as the file to upload!

![](./Images/image6.3.3.FileUpload.png)
  *Image 6.3.3 File upload*

**11) Click Send! Then, review the response.**

![](./Images/image6.3.4.UploadResponse.png)
  *Image 6.3.4 File upload response*


#### Run the Job

**12) Enter the following URL and Headers into Postman.**

**Request**

    POST
    http://<yourServerHost>/fmerest/v3/transformations/submit/RESTTraining/Chapter6Exercise11.fmw
    Accept: application/json
    Content-Type: application/json
    Authorization: fmetoken token= <yourToken>


  ![](./Images/image6.3.5.SubmitURL.png)
      *Image 6.3.5 Submit URLs and headers*

**13) Switch to the body tab in Postman.**

**14) Click the raw. Then, paste the following information.**

    {
    "publishedParameters": [
    {
      "name": "DestDataset_CSV2",
      "value": "$(FME_SHAREDRESOURCE_TEMP)"
    }
    ]
    }

  ![](./Images/image6.3.6.SubmitBody.png)
    *Image 6.3.6 Submit body*


**15) Review the Response from the FME Server**

    {

    "id": 29

    }

![](./Images/image6.3.7.SubmitResult.png)
*Image 6.3.7 Submit result*


Please Note. The job ID that is returned by the Server will be different based on how many jobs the FME Server has completed.

#### Test the Job was Successful

**16) Enter the Following call into Postman. Then, Click Send!**

This call will run asynchronously so in return you will receive an id.
To check that your call has been completed, use this call.

***Replace 29 with the ID you received from the last call***

    GET http://localhost/fmerest/v3/transformations/jobs/id/29
    Accept: application/json
    Authorization: fmetoken token= YOUR TOKEN

**17) Review the Response to ensure the job was completed successfully**


![](./Images/image6.3.8.JobResult.png)
*Image 6.3.8 Job result*



#### Download the Resulting File


**18) Enter in the Request URL and Headers into Postman**

Then you can download the file using the call below.

     POST http://<yourServerHost>/fmerest/v3/resources/connections/FME_SHAREDRESOURCE_TEMP/download/Business_Licences.csv

    Accept: application/octet-stream
    Authorization: fmetoken token=<yourToken>
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlendcoded

  ![](./Images/image6.3.9.ConnectionsHeaders.png)
  *Image 6.3.9 The connection call headers and body*

**19) Switch to the body tab in Postman.**

**20) Click the raw. Then, paste the following information. Click Send!**

    accept=contents&disposition=inline

**21) Review the Response in Postman!**

While Postman can process the call the CSV file cannot be downloaded.
