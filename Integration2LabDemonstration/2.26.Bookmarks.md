## Bookmarks ##
A bookmark, like its real-world namesake, is a means of putting a marker down for easy access.

With FME the bookmark covers an area of workspace that is usually carrying out a specific task, so a user can pick it out of a larger set of transformers and move to it with relative ease.


### Why use Bookmarks? ###
Bookmarks play an important role in a well-styled workspace for a number of reasons, including these.

- Design: As a way to subdivide a workspace and manage those sections
- Access: As a marker for quick access to a certain section of workspace
- Editing: As a means to move groups of transformers at a time
- Performance: As a means to improve workspace performance when caching data


### Adding a Bookmark ###
To add a bookmark, click the Bookmark icon on the toolbar.

Whereas a traditional bookmark marks just a single page in a book, the FME bookmark can cover a wide area of the canvas. A single workspace can be divided into different sections by applying multiple bookmarks.

<td style="vertical-align:middle;background-color:darkorange;border: 2px solid darkorange">
<i class="fa fa-info-circle fa-lg fa-pull-left fa-fw" style="color:white;padding-right: 12px;vertical-align:text-top"></i>
<span style="color:white;font-size:x-large;font-weight: bold;font-family:serif">TIP</span>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td style="border: 1px solid darkorange">
<span style="font-family:serif; font-style:italic; font-size:larger">
If any objects on the workspace canvas are selected when a bookmark is created, the bookmark is automatically expanded to include those items.

### Resizing and Editing a Bookmark ###
To resize a bookmark simply hover over a corner or edge and then drag the cursor to change the bookmark size or shape.

### Bookmark Properties ###
Click the cogwheel icon on a bookmark header to open the bookmark properties dialog:

Here you can change both the name and color of the bookmark, and decide about whether contents will move with it (more on that later).

The context (right-click) menu for a bookmark reveals options to select all objects within the bookmark, or to disable all of those objects, making it useful for testing purposes:
