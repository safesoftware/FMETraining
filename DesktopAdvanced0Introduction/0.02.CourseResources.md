# Course Resources #
This course uses a number of sample datasets and workspaces.

## On Your Training Computer ##
The data used in this training course is based on open data from the City of Vancouver, Canada.

Most exercises ask you to assume the role of a city planner at the fictional city of Interopolis and to solve a particular problem using this data.

Whether it's a local computer or a virtual computer hosted in the cloud, you'll find resources for the examples and exercises in the manual at the following locations:

<table>

<tr>
<th>Location</th>
<th>Resource</th>

<tr>
<td>C:\FMEData2018\Data</td>
<td>Datasets used by the City of Interopolis</td>

<td>C:\FMEData2018\Resources</td>
<td>Other resources used in the training</td>

<tr>
<td>C:\FMEData2018\Workspaces</td>

<td>C:\FMEData2018\Output</td>
<td>The location in which to write exercise output</td>

<tr>
<td><documents>\FME\Workspaces</td>
<td>The default location to save FME workspaces</td>

</table>

You should also find FME pre-installed, plus a digital copy of this manual.

Please alert your instructor if any item is missing from your setup.
