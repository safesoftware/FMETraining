# Module Review #
This session was designed to help you understand the different components of a translation, how they can be controlled, and how they interact.

 
## What You Should Have Learned from this Module ##
The following are key points to be learned from this session:

### Theory ###

- A translation is made up of a Workspace, Readers and Writers, and Feature Types. Tools exist to manage all of these components
- Readers and Writers are defined by entries in the Navigator window, Feature Types by objects in the workspace canvas
- Translations are controlled by Reader and Writer Parameters, and Feature Type Parameters
- Datasets are selected by Reader and Writer parameters in the Navigator window, not in the canvas
- The Unexpected Input Remover filters incoming data if it doesn’t match a known feature type defined in the workspace

### FME Skills ###

- The ability to set up and manage the components of a translation
- The ability to control a translation with read and write parameters
- The ability to handle source datasets regardless of feature type or attributes.
