Safe Software created FME in 1993 to aid forestry companies exchange maps with the British Columbia provincial government. It was technically possible to share maps then, but only after hours of fighting with the data and often much information was lost. FME was built for better data integration: allowing the exchange of maps in different formats without losing any information.

FME is still used widely in forestry and other industries using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for mapping and spatial analysis. The scenarios in this module are based on GIS use-cases, but the skills covered are widely applicable to any industry that requires data manipulation. If you would like to learn more about GIS, these articles from the [University of Wisconsin](https://researchguides.library.wisc.edu/GIS) and [GIS Lounge](https://www.gislounge.com/what-is-gis/) provide useful information.

This module covers using FME Desktop for data translations and transformations at the desktop level. FME Desktop is one piece of software in a larger ecosystem:

- FME Desktop lets you connect and transform data.
  - For example, taking an Excel spreadsheet of business information and addresses and adding it to a database of neighborhood demographic information stored in a Geographic Information System.
- FME Server provides enterprise-level automation.
  - For example, allowing business licensing officers working for a city government to add new business licenses to the database created in Desktop in real time by sending an email or filling out a web form.
- FME Cloud is the hosted version of FME Server.
  - For example, the server that carries out the operation in the example above could be hosted in the cloud, rather than directly by the City.

FME Desktop consists of a number of different tools and applications. The two key applications are FME Workbench and the FME Data Inspector. We will cover FME Workbench and FME Data Inspector in the Lab Demonstration.
