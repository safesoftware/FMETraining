# Lecture

This section of the module discusses the concept of data integration, illustrates why it matters, and previews how FME can be used to integrate data.

It is designed to be delivered as a classroom lecture before students enter the lab. The concepts discussed here will be explored in more detail within the context of FME Desktop in the [Lab Demonstration section](../Integration2LabDemonstration/2.00.LabDemonstration.md).

## Learning Objectives

Students will learn:

1. **Data integration** is a key technical and business challenge for contemporary organizations.
2. **FME** is a tool to translate and transform data.
3. **FME Desktop** is for data translations and transformations at the desktop level.
4. **Structural transformation** is perhaps better called ‘reorganization'. It includes the ability to merge data (as in the image above), divide data, re-order data, and define custom data structures.
5. **Content transformation** is perhaps better called ‘revision'. It refers to the ability to alter the substance of a dataset, for example changing a feature's attribute values or geometry.
