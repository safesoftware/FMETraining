<ul>
<li>Read a dataset from a URL.</li>
<li>Read a dataset using the Select File From Web option.</li>

<h2 id="web-based-datasets">Web-Based Datasets</h2>
<p>There can be no doubt about the trend toward storing data in the cloud, including spatial data. For that reason, FME has comprehensive tools for reading web-based datasets.</p>

<h2 id="simple-url-selection">Simple URL Selection</h2>
<p>The easiest way to read a web-based dataset is to paste the URL into the source Dataset parameter.</p>

<p>Here the workspace author is adding a reader to read a MapInfo TAB dataset directly from an open data catalog stored on Amazon S3.</p>

<p>A folder-based dataset must be compressed to a single zip file for FME to read it from the web like this; the above perfectly illustrates that requirement. Datasets can be read from non-zipped datasets, but only when the dataset consists of a single file (such as an AutoCAD DWG file).</p>

<p>The URL entered into a source dataset field may refer to any resource on a web-based file storage system. For example, here, a user is reading the same MapInfo TAB dataset directly from a Dropbox link:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/read-and-write-archive-and-web-formats/reading-and-writing-web-based-datasets/images/1664817174296.png" alt="Reading from a Dropbox URL" /></p>
<p>The key is forcing the web service to provide a direct link to the file rather than its web interface. For example, to force Dropbox to provide a direct link, you should&nbsp;<a href="https://help.dropbox.com/share/force-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set the dl query parameter</a>&nbsp;to 1 in the URL, as in the above screenshot, instead of the default value of 0 (zero).</p>
<p>If data is read from a website data needing authentication, most readers have parameters to enter such information:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/read-and-write-archive-and-web-formats/reading-and-writing-web-based-datasets/images/1664817250122.png" alt="Use Network Authentication parameter" /></p>
<p>However, there are better ways to read data from a web service.</p>
<h2 id="web-services">Web Services</h2>
<p>Besides being able to read from a URL, FME can directly access certain web services to read data. Direct access to a web service is achieved with functionality inside FME called&nbsp;<strong>w</strong><strong>eb connections</strong>.</p>
<p>Web Connections are created by selecting Tools &gt; FME Options &gt; Web Connections on the FME Workbench menu bar and clicking the plus button in the Web Connections dialog:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/read-and-write-archive-and-web-formats/reading-and-writing-web-based-datasets/images/1664821615717.png" alt="Adding a Web Connection" /></p>
<p>New web service support is added regularly to FME. With the new&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Desktop/Workbench/options-FME-packages.htm?gclid=Cj0KCQjwkOqZBhDNARIsAACsbfLlulUHfO4CTQh47ewg_FLmUnJEGJQg_T28OtVru0o1ZMRZH5xPXacaAocuEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FME packages</a>&nbsp;system,&nbsp;<a href="https://community.safe.com/s/article/fme-packages-faq#WebConnections" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">web connections can be updated</a>&nbsp;without needing to update all of FME. You can also define custom web connections and share them with other users on&nbsp;<a href="https://hub.safe.com/?page=1&amp;types=web_connections&amp;order=updated_at_desc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the FME Hub</a>.</p>
<p>FME supports connections for a large number of web services - and the Manage Services button allows you to integrate any other web service you require - but some key ones are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amazon S3</li>
<li>Autodesk A360</li>
<li>Box</li>
<li>Dropbox</li>
<li>FME Server</li>
<li>Google Drive</li>
<li>HDSF</li>
<li>Microsoft OneDrive</li>
</ul>
<p>These are key types because they are capable of storing data in a way that can be accessed directly from the Add Reader dialogs:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/read-and-write-archive-and-web-formats/reading-and-writing-web-based-datasets/images/1664821770426.png" alt="Select File from Web dialog" /></p>
<p>In the above screenshot, an author is adding a MapInfo dataset from Amazon S3. This action opens a dialog in which they can browse Amazon S3 for the required file:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/read-and-write-archive-and-web-formats/reading-and-writing-web-based-datasets/images/1664821790386.png" alt="Selecting data from S3" /></p>
<p>The reader is then added to the workspace and functions like any other.</p>
<p>Note that if you wish to use a FeatureReader transformer instead of a reader, then the same "Select File From Web" option is available.</p>

<p>Usually, you need to authenticate when adding a new web service connection into FME. Suppose the workspace is published to FME Server or copied to another FME Desktop installation. In that case, you must re-authenticate the new location. You can also&nbsp;<a href="https://community.safe.com/s/article/making-database-and-web-connections-public" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">make database and web connections public</a>.</p>

<h2 id="connector-transformers">Connector Transformers</h2>
<p>Besides being able to direct a reader to a web service, various transformers exist that can read files. These are similar to the list supported by readers:</p>
<table class="featureTable sort_table">
<tbody class="tbody">
<tr>
<td>AzureBlobStorageConnector</td>
<td>DropboxConnector</td>
<td>ProjectWiseWSGConnector</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AzureFileStorageConnector</td>
<td>FMEServerResourceConnector</td>
<td>S3Connector</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>AutodeskA360Connector</td>
<td>GoogleDriveConnector</td>
<td>SalesForceConnector</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>BoxConnector</td>
<td>HDFSConnector</td>
<td>SlackConnector</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CesiumIonConnector</td>
<td>OneDriveConnector</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>These transformers don't&nbsp;<em>read</em>&nbsp;data in the traditional FME sense. Instead, they copy a selected file and either add its contents to an attribute or download the file to the local filesystem.</p>
<p>Here, for example, an author is using a Creator transformer to trigger the reading of a file from Google Drive:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/read-and-write-archive-and-web-formats/reading-and-writing-web-based-datasets/images/1664822033931.png" alt="Creator plus GoogleDriveConnector" /></p>
<p>FME adds the file's contents to an attribute you can process as required. For example, maybe it is a snippet of XML that can be decoded with an XML transformer.</p>

<p>Connector transformers can also upload a file, list the contents of a web service, and delete files from that service.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given the "Select File From Web" tool on readers, Connector transformers are not generally intended for reading source data. However, they could be used to download a file that is then read using a FeatureReader.</p>
<p>Another use would be to retrieve a list of files that are then read directly using a FeatureReader.</p>
<p>However, the more likely use is to transfer written data to the web. Writers don't have an equivalent "Select File From Web" option. The best alternative is to write data with a FeatureWriter transformer and then use a Connector transformer to transfer that data to a web service of choice.</p>
