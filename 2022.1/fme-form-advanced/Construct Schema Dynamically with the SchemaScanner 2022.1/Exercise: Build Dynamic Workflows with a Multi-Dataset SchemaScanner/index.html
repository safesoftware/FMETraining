<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>At a basic level, the SchemaScanner is fairly simple to operate. However, more complex scenarios revolve around how the different parameters are used and the exact values of incoming data.</p>
<p>The Empty attributes parameter controls the schema when incoming data has missing values:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.safe.com/hc/article_attachments/25409026475021" alt="SchemaScannerB1.png" /></p>
<p>However, this only applies to data where the entire dataset is missing a particular attribute value. In this dataset, for example, every value for MarketType is null. MergedAddress also has null values, but not for every record:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.safe.com/hc/article_attachments/25409054356749" alt="SchemaScannerB2.png" /></p>
<p>Given the above parameters, the output schema will not contain the MarketType field because there are no values at all for it:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.safe.com/hc/article_attachments/25409047382669" alt="SchemaScannerB3.png" /></p>
<p>However, MergedAddress&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>included because some records still do have values.</p>
<p>Now, say, for example, that we wanted to include MarketType in the output even though there are no values. There are two alternatives to the Ignore option:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.safe.com/hc/article_attachments/25409060110605" alt="SchemaScannerB4.png" /></p>
<p>Because there are no data values, the SchemaScanner cannot scan the data to guess the data type. Instead, it can either use a default data type (a varchar of unknown length) or trace back through the workspace to find any clues to the data type.</p>
<p>In this case, the reader itself has that information:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.safe.com/hc/article_attachments/25409047432845" alt="SchemaScannerB5.png" /></p>
<p>&hellip;so the SchemaScanner will use that and create an output schema where MarketType = varchar(15).</p>
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>This exercise aims to add more data to the&nbsp;previous exercise's&nbsp;output by merging different source data sets.</p>
<h2 id="1-open-workspace">1. Open Workspace</h2>
<p>Continue with the workspace from the&nbsp;previous exercise&nbsp;or open the starting workspace in FME Workbench (2022.1 or later). Now let's add the&nbsp;<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData/Resources/DynamicWorkflows/Data/Vancouver%20Farmers%20Markets.csv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vancouver Farmers Market CSV dataset</a>&nbsp;(or C:\FMEData\Resources\DynamicWorkflows\Data\Vancouver Farmers Markets.csv), keeping the existing Cedar Cottage data. You can do this in one of two ways:</p>
<p><strong>1a. Add a New CSV Reader.</strong></p>
<p>Either use Reader &gt; Add Reader from the menu bar or drag/drop the CSV file into the workspace canvas. Connect the new feature type to the&nbsp;<strong>AttributeManager</strong>&nbsp;input port.</p>
<p><strong>1b. Edit the Existing CSV Reader</strong></p>
<p>In the Navigator window, double-click the Source CSV parameter for the existing CSV Reader. When it opens, click the drop-down arrow and choose&nbsp;<strong>Select Multiple Folders/Files</strong>:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.safe.com/hc/article_attachments/25409047492493" alt="SchemaScannerB11.png" /></p>
<p>Click&nbsp;<strong>Add Files</strong>&nbsp;in the dialog and choose the Vancouver Farmers Market CSV file. Because the existing reader is dynamic, you won&rsquo;t have to add a new feature type.</p>
<h2 id="2-run-workspace">2. Run Workspace</h2>
<p>Run the workspace and inspect the output. You&rsquo;ll notice that the Vancouver Farmers Market data has no values for&nbsp;<strong>MarketType</strong>, so their values are Null. Also, notice that the data has an extra field called Offerings, which Cedar Cottage is missing:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.safe.com/hc/article_attachments/25409028771981" alt="SchemaScannerB6.png" /></p>
<p>These fields were included in the output CSV, even though not all data possessed them. That&rsquo;s because the SchemaScanner creates an inclusive schema, i.e., if only one feature possesses an attribute, it will be included in the output.</p>
<h2 id="3-create-different-outputs-for-each-day">3. Create Different Outputs for Each Day</h2>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s create a different file for each day of the week, i.e., we wish to divide food markets into different outputs depending on which day they take place.</p>
<p>Open the parameters dialog for the writer feature type.</p>
<p>Change the CSV File Name parameter from fme_feature_type to the Day attribute by clicking the drop-down arrow.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://support.safe.com/hc/article_attachments/25409069911949" alt="SchemaScannerB7.png" /></p>
<p>Re-run the workspace and inspect the outputs in a Text Editor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the Saturday and Sunday files, some fields have null values, but the fields still exist because not every record is null:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.safe.com/hc/article_attachments/25409060346381" alt="SchemaScannerB12.png" /></p>
<p>In the Wednesday and Thursday files, some fields are entirely null. However, the fields still exist because there is only one output schema, and every output dataset uses it.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.safe.com/hc/article_attachments/25409047747469" alt="SchemaScannerB13.png" /></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how we could give each output a different schema.</p>
<h2 id="4-update-schema-scanner-to-group-features">4. Update SchemaScanner to Group Features</h2>
<p>View the SchemaScanner parameters. Enable Group Processing, and under Group By, choose the Day attribute.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.safe.com/hc/article_attachments/25409028927885" alt="SchemaScannerB8.png" /></p>
<p>Re-run the workspace. Notice that there are now four schema features, one per day of the week:</p>
<p><img src="https://support.safe.com/hc/article_attachments/25409028961549" alt="SchemaScannerB9.png" /></p>
<p>Notice that fme_feature_type_name - the attribute that sets the schema's name - defines the difference between each feature.</p>
<p>Inspect the output. If a dataset was missing an entire attribute, then that attribute is now absent in the output. Each dataset has its own schema, and the SchemaScanner is set to Ignore Empty Attributes.</p>
<h2 id="5-output-individual-schemas">5. Output Individual Schemas</h2>
<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s say we wanted to give each output its own schema, but we didn&rsquo;t want empty attributes to be ignored. How would we do that?</p>
<p>View the SchemaScanner parameters again. Change the Empty Attributes parameter from &ldquo;Ignore&rdquo; to &ldquo;Interpret Upstream Schema (Advanced).&rdquo; Now FME will include those attributes, obtaining the information to create the schema from wherever it can find that upstream in the workspace.</p>
<p>Once again, run the workspace and inspect the Schema features, particularly the one for Thursday markets.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.safe.com/hc/article_attachments/25409028983309" alt="SchemaScannerB10.png" /></p>
<p>Previously the Thursday market did not have a MarketType attribute in its schema. Now it does, even though all of the values are empty. The type is fme_varchar(22) because FME could determine that from the reader schema.</p>
