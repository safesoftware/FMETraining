# Module Review

This chapter looked at FME Performance and some of the techniques available to improve it

## What You Should Have Learned from this Module ##

The following are key points to be learned from this session: 

### Theory ###

- Performance is the measure of useful work done in a given time. Excess data and caching of data to disk are two factors that can impact performance greatly
- 64-bit FME can make use of more system memory, but does not have the same format reach that 32-bit FME does
- Analyzing a log file helps to determine where performance improvements can be made
- Improve reading performance by reducing the amount of data being read
- Improve writing performance by ordering the FME Writers correctly
- Improve transformation performance by removing excess attributes and properly managing group-based transformers
- Make use of all reader/writer parameters to improve database performance
- Employ parallel processing to make FME multi-threaded
- Upload larger tasks to multiple engines on FME Server 

### FME Skills ###

- The ability to analyze and deconstruct an FME log file
- An understanding of potential methods for improving reader, writer, and transformer performance
- The ability to use database parameters to improve performance
- The ability to apply parallel processing in an FME workspace
