- Databases can have a container of connection information created and stored on FME Server

- Data (and other related files) can be uploaded and stored on FME Server in various ways; either published data, temporary uploads, or as “Resources”

- Workspaces can be authored in FME Desktop specifically to use data stored in FME Server resource folders 

- Developer information is provided to help run workspaces via a URL

- Workspaces can be run in a series of translations using a technique called *chaining*
