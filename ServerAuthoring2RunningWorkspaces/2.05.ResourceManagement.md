Source data may be published to FME Server and stored in a “Resources” folder, where it is available to any workspace

FME Server has several mechanisms for uploading and storing resources for workspaces to use in a translation; for example the source data for a translation.

One such mechanism is called “Resources” or “Resource Management”, and is accessed through the Web User Interface.

The advantage of these Resources, compared to other methods, is that data can be uploaded and referenced by any workspace, without having to upload it every time. This is particularly useful when access to the file system is restricted (like on an FME Cloud system).

If the workspace author does have access to the file system, then Resources are still useful, as a Resources folder can be mapped and shared among many users as a physical drive.


**Accessing Resources**

Resources are accessed through the Manage, then Resources on the main menu.

**Resource Functionality**

The various resource functions are:
- Upload
- New Folder
- Download
