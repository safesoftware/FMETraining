### 7.2 Retrieve Job History

Pagination of results is useful for endpoints that return a collection
of objects, especially when the collection has large amounts of results.
To help users work with pages of results, we improved the response body
to be the following structure:

-   items (array\[Object\]): Items in this results page

-   limit (integer): limits how many items are returned by this call. Could set it to 10 to only retrieve 10 jobs at a time.

-   offset (integer): Offset of this results page

-   totalCount (integer): Total amount of items available

It is possible to hit the max number of responses allowed by the REST
API, currently, there are only 1000 responses allowed in one request. If
you are retrieving your entire job history it is likely that is will be
over 1000 responses.

So, we can use the offset to gather 1000 responses at a time. The offset
starts from the newest and subtracts from the offset number. Let's say
you have a busy server with 10,000 jobs and you wanted to retrieve the
full job history. For the first call, you would want to set the limit to
1000 and the offset to 0. This will retrieve the newest 1000 jobs. The
next call would have to set the limit to 1000 and the offset to 1000.
This would retrieve the next newest 1000 jobs.

The next exercise demonstrates how you could retrieve job history and
create an HTML report with the information.
