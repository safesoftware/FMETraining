# Course Overview #

This training course provides a framework for a basic understanding of FME. We find users come to master one function, but go home with many new FME uses!

The training will introduce basic concepts and terminology, help students become efficient users of FME, and direct you to resources to help apply the product to your own needs.

## Course Structure ##

The full course is made up of five main sections. These sections are:

- Data Translation Basics
- Readers and Writers
- Data Transformation
- Practical Transformer Use
- FME Best Practice

The instructor may choose to cover as many of these sections as they feel are required, or possible in the time permitted. They may also cover the course content in a different order and will skip or add new content to better customize the course to your needs.

Therefore the length and content of the course may vary, particularly when delivered online.

## About the Manual ##
The FME Desktop training manual not only forms the basis for FME Desktop training – in-person or online – but is also useful reference material for future work you may undertake with FME.
