# Module Overview

This module provides an introduction to the concept of data integration and interoperability and contains hands-on examples of using Safe Software's FME to integrate data.

The module introduces basic concepts and terminology, help students become efficient users of FME, and direct them to resources to learn more about the product.

## Module Structure

The full module is made up of three main sections. These sections are:

- Lecture
- Lab Instruction
- Lab Exercises

The **Lecture** section is intended to be adapted by instructors to be taught in a classroom lecture. It covers conceptual issues of data integration and provides a high-level introduction to FME. Slides are provided [here]().

The **Lab Demonstration** section provides a walkthrough of how to use FME. It can be delivered by an instructor and/or students can complete it on their own computers.

Finally, the **Lab Exercises** section provides hands-on activities for students to complete during lab time or as assignments. It contains questions; instructors may access the answers for use in grading [here]().

## Module Audience

This module is aimed at a second- to fourth-year university or college student audience. Computer and data analysis experience will help, but is not required. Prior knowledge of FME is not required. If the instructor wishes to adapt the module to a higher level, the lecture and lab demonstration content could be shortened.

## Module Length

The instructor may choose to cover as many of these sections as they feel are required, or possible in the time permitted. They may also cover the module content in a different order and will skip or add new content to better customize the module to their needs. Therefore, the length and content of the module may vary.

All of this content is provided for instructors to use, adapt, and remix for their own modules. Please note that this use does come with some legal caveats, explained in [About this Document](/Integration0About/0.00.AboutThisDocument.md).
