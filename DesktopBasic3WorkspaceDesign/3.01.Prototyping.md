# Prototyping #

In the classical sense, prototyping means creating an incomplete application as a way to evaluate the feasibility of a project.

Here we'll stretch the definition to mean how to build a complex FME project incrementally; starting with an empty workspace and building it piece by piece to deliver a result that matches the final specification.

This includes what techniques are useful for building a workspace incrementally, and how to handle data that is rejected by a transformer.
