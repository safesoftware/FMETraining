## Chapter 4- Interacting with Workspaces

In this chapter, we will look at the various ways to run a workspace on your FME Server using the REST API.   

There are two main ways a user can submit a job on the REST API. The first is synchronously and the second is asynchronously.

A synchronous task has to be completed before the next task will begin. Running a call synchronously is good when you need to know the results immediately and it is a short task.

An asynchronous task will not wait for the job to complete before returning a response. Instead of the job results it, will return a job ID immediately then you can use the ID to obtain the status of the job. Running a call asynchronously is good if you don't need an immediate response or if it is a large task.
