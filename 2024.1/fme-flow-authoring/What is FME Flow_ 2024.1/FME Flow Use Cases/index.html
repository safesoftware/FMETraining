<p>&ldquo;FME does all my work for me while I sleep at night. It&rsquo;s absolutely a life saver.&rdquo; -- Jerrod Stutzman, GIS Platform Engineer, Devon Energy</p>

<p><img class="image" src="images/1624883206440.png" alt="Devon Energy logo" /></p>
<p>Devon Energy uses FME to centralize spatial system stores and display SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) data on a map for easy access.</p>
<p>FME workflows automatically synchronize data from multiple disparate sources, replacing tedious manual effort. Transformation and validation processes in the workflows ensure that information is accurate and complete regardless of where or how it was originally stored.</p>
<p>End users can now quickly access identical information, regardless of whether they&rsquo;re using a computer in the office or a mobile device in the field.</p>
<p>Devon Energy is one of the largest independent natural gas and oil producers headquartered in the United States, specializing in onshore exploration and production in North America.</p>

<h2>The University of Washington</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;We were able to create an FME workspace that did exactly what I needed in less time than Python.&rdquo; &ndash; Aaron Cheuvront, CAD/GIS Program Manager at the University of Washington</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="images/Signature_Stacked_Purple_Hex-300x148.png" alt="University of Washington logo" width="300" height="148" /></p>
<p><br />The University of Washington needed to implement an automated process to more accurately update AutoCAD floor plan drawings into a seamless, multi-campus Geodatabase. FME Form workflows were created that enabled facility managers to integrate floorplans, outlines, basemaps, and archives to create simple 3D maps. Scheduled updates maintain synchronization, enabling CAD changes to be loaded into a SQL Server staging area, quality checked, and incrementally updated in the GIS. Future plans include the option to run the Floorplan Sync Engine on FME Flow Hosted.</p>
<p>This innovative solution enabled the University of Washington to map 1700 floors and 24 million square feet of interior space. &nbsp;Their new and improved automated system saves time, allowing them to focus more on developing innovative ways to use the GIS, while also ensuring decisions are based on the most accurate information.</p>
<p>Located on 643 acres in Seattle, the University of Washington educates approximately 50,000 students annually. The facilities maintenance team is responsible for managing over 500 buildings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;I love FME because it just makes my job easier every day.&rdquo; -- Carlos Silva, Vancouver International Airport</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img class="image" src="images/1624883670212.png" alt="Vancouver International Airport logo" /></p>
<p>The Vancouver International Airport (YVR) wanted to provide passengers with indoor mapping data via their mobile app.</p>
<p>Using FME, they combined source data from Maximo with CAD. The FME workspaces standardized and performed quality assurance and validation checks (QA/QC) before converting the data into an ArcSDE GIS database.</p>
<p>They published FME workspaces to FME Flow to nightly filter, convert, and aggregate floor spaces into new datasets (ArcSDE) that only contain public spaces of the airport, and convert this dataset into GeoJSON for delivery into the YVR Digital Gateway, an enterprise service bus deployed on the Microsoft Azure cloud platform. This dataset is then used for the creation of three final products: the 3D interactive indoor map in their app, an AVF (now IMDF) dataset they submitted to Apple, and a leaflet indoor basemap for yvr.ca.</p>
<p>YVR is one of the first to provide its indoor mapping data to Apple Maps, and its GIS team has proven their innovation by providing a variety of ways to navigate the public indoor spaces of the airport using digital technology.</p>
<p>Vancouver International Airport, Canada, serves over 22 million passengers per year and has won the SKYTRAX Best Airport in North America award for eight years running.</p>

<h2>City of Naperville</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;With FME, we were suddenly saying &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; to other departments and implementing requests quickly. Now, we&rsquo;re viewed differently in our interactions. FME makes it easy for us to improve our relationships with other departments by helping improve their business processes.&rdquo; &ndash; Danielle DuBose, Database Developer, City of Naperville</span></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="images/logo.png" alt="" width="444" height="167" /></span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span></em><em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naperville has used FME to automate the creation of new meters and the permanent removals of meters in Cityworks, resulting in 2200+ Electric department service requests automated and hours spent on manual entry eliminated. Naperville has also expanded FME into their Public Works department&rsquo;s ArcGIS Survey123 process. Citizens report via a web form, and FME automatically transforms survey data into service requests for tree trimming, winter forestry operations, damaged mailboxes, and more. Cityworks automations also pull data from Survey123 to create work orders for retirement signs, and the Public Works department also uses a gallery app for loading and treating ordinance permit data. In just a year, the Public Works department has automated 1100+ service requests with FME.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naperville has also expanded their uses of FME across their Finance and IT departments, improving collaboration across multiple departments. Automating requests and workflows has freed significant amounts of time for staff to focus on other high-value tasks. Without FME, many of Naperville&rsquo;s projects would&rsquo;ve been impossible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naperville has automated over 3,300 services requested and work orders, allowing one employee to achieve the work of three specialized staff.</span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;FME Flow allowed us to offload processing from our Oracle databases and expedited our public map rollout by avoiding developing code to do the same job.&rdquo; -- Eric Abrams, Iowa Department of Transportation</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img class="image" src="images/1624884106509.png" alt="Iowa DOT logo" /></p>
<p>The Iowa Department of Transportation (Iowa DOT) wanted to deliver the near-real-time situational awareness they already accessed internally via a public-facing plowcam portal.</p>
<p>Using FME alongside ArcGIS Online (AGOL), Oracle, KML, and Microsoft Azure, they now provide plow data and cam imagery via a web portal. In the background, FME Flow retrieves the active plow data from Oracle once per minute, and creates a KML file that is uploaded to Windows Azure. AGOL accesses that KML to build the online representation, refreshed at regular intervals.</p>
<p>Using the public site, individuals can visually check conditions before setting out on the road, making for safer driving. Media and weather outlets are taking advantage of this near-real-time situational awareness too, tweeting out plow images to their audiences.</p>
<p>Iowa DOT maintains over 9,400 miles of roadway and 4,092 bridges to serve the transportation needs of the state's citizens.</p>
