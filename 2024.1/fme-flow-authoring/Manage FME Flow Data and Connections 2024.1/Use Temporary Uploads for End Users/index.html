<h2 id="uploading-datasets-at-run-time">Uploading Datasets at Run Time</h2>
<p>Although it's easy for an author to publish data to an FME Flow repository along with the workspace, it isn't a method that an end-user has access to.</p>
<p>Therefore, for files (rather than a feed or database), functionality exists to allow the end-user to upload data at run-time.</p>
<h2 id="uploading-source-data">Uploading Source Data</h2>
<p>The workspace below was created with a dynamic Reader and Writer. That means it is possible to process any source dataset (of the right format) and have it translated:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Server-Authoring-2020/ServerAuthoring2DataHandling/Images/Img2.013.TempUploadDynamicWorkspace.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1730495603977.png" alt="Dynamic reader and writer workspace" width="487" height="85" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, in this scenario publishing the data with the workspace does not make much sense. It is better if the user uploads data at runtime.</p>
<p>Provided the source dataset is a published parameter, this can be done easily in the Run Workspace page of the FME Flow interface by dragging and dropping a file into the browser, or clicking the browse button:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JHkVHErGfx9br4bSEmsxk7ySkhxfNP5V0X6yXEp52qUyR6bODopszMTEst_M27XMYF5kXGIpgy905zLDLTHC0q7PDOSpYAt9SN5IRpfb_29XGk0k-hoUBPNYSVuHxE8HRo80CKNmJRrwE33ejqrNU2w" alt="Providing a source MapInfo TAB file" width="717" height="324" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This opens a dialog to select one or more files for the data type.</p>
<p>1. To only upload the file temporarily, switch to the Temporary Uploads tab<br />2. Click on the &ldquo;browse file system text&rdquo; or drag and drop the files into the Upload Files box. When uploading data that contains multiple files (like MapInfo Tab) ensure that you select all of the files.<br />3. Once the data is uploaded to the Temporary Uploads, it will need to be added to the workspace, this is done by clicking on the green plus sign next to each file. Notice that selected items will have a green check mark and will be listed in the Selected Items panel&nbsp;<br />4. All the files need to be uploaded, but only the main file needs to be selected for the workspace to run correctly, in this case, Parks.tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1733509683831.jpg" alt="Uploading a file" width="779" height="616" /></p>
<p>Now when the workspace runs, the selected user-uploaded data gets translated.</p>
<h2 id="selecting-files">Selecting Files</h2>
<p>In the above example, the source dataset is in a format (MapInfo TAB) that consists of several files.</p>
<p>Although all files need to be uploaded, only the TAB file itself needs to be&nbsp;<strong>selected</strong>.<br /><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1733509853770.jpg" alt="Removing the .map file" width="293" height="141" /><br /><br />The method to use is to deselect files under the section Selected Items; here the .dat, .id, and .map files are deselected.</p>
<p>The files are still available, but FME won't treat each of them as a separate dataset, which is what would happen if they all remained selected.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">This method is useful for formats that require&nbsp;</span><a style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidecar_file" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"sidecar" files</a><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">, such as Esri Shapefile or MapInfo TAB.</span></p>

<h2 id="cautions-and-limitations">Cautions and Limitations</h2>
<p>There are some cautions and limitations to consider when data is uploaded for translation by the end-user:</p>
<ul>
<li>Giving the user upload ability is risky because their dataset's schema has to match the workspace's schema definition; otherwise, the translation will fail with unexpected input. Alternatively - as above - a dynamic (and maybe generic) translation could be used to avoid such issues.</li>
<li>Data uploaded by the user is only temporarily available. The System Cleanup page shows us that such files are (by default) deleted when they become more than 24 hours old. User uploads are not a long-term solution.</li>
<li>Data uploaded by the user is, in theory, also accessible through the Resources page (more on that to come). However, in practice, it's in an obscure location where an end-user would not be expected to find it. For that reason, temporary data should be considered inaccessible by any other means and unavailable for use by any other workspace.</li>
</ul>
