<h2 id="sharing-fme-server-content">Sharing FME Flow Content</h2>
<p>Whether you own a component or someone else gave you access to it impacts how FME Flow security functions. A component might be a set of functionality or an object like a repository.</p>
<p>When you create something, you have full permission for that component. Even if you don't have permission to manage security on your FME Flow, you can share a component you own with another user.</p>
<p>Generally, sharing works two ways depending on the method:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sharing a component with other FME Flow users through the Sharing Options dialog.</li>
<li>Sharing a workspace with users without an FME Flow account through Flow Apps, Webhook URLs, or the FME Flow REST API.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="sharing-a-repository">Sharing a Repository</h2>
<p>When you choose the Workspaces menu option in the Flow web interface, you will see a list of the system's repositories.</p>
<p>If you are the owner of a repository, then you can click the button to <em>Share with Others</em>:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4K8SDzyKcGuDwQfp8UC5NzfyV2zX8q7xGc8rR5EbPwDseZzCXi7T6-0GtgHIzInNtDoqhHGB1u8XnuscNzpKBrWtY9aJzDoMSvtf1TUommY9lPb-lMVxMUnDvH031TSlNl5Q-5brjJvBHpWW" alt="Sharing a repository" width="880" height="511" /></p>
<p>Clicking this button opens a pop-up dialog where you can select a user and choose the level of permission that you wish to give them:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gi4uUYxIqtrlanfqWxkfj_RANKVk7mu-k9SXi92JSh9ors8g29lN5Ur2WV1cvY3F9iNk_wn1do0XfXI1EONcGIcO9lww1RCJNO2AUjmL0cAuZdpqkKQhyJX8UrddkAhI7GoXWfyuiuvDWrZh" alt="Granting Full Access to a repository" width="558" height="250" /></p>
<p>Users and roles also impact FME Flow security. Roles are analogous to a group of users. When sharing a component, the "user" field can be an individual user or applied to a particular role. For example, you can give anyone in the fmeuser role the ability to run workspaces in a repository.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="https://safemytrailhead.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Security is a critical capability. As an author, you might publish a workspace for multiple users within FME Flow. However, they can only use the workspace if they have access.</span></p>
<p>The Sharing Options dialog allows you to open access to your workspace without needing the advanced permissions required for complete security control.</p>
<p>In addition to repositories, you can share other components of FME Flow with other users. Watch the user interface for other sharing opportunities.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="fme-server-apps">FME Flow Apps</h2>
<p>Sharing a repository is an excellent option for sharing workspaces with other users who also have access to FME Flow, but what if you want to allow anyone to submit a job without needing an account on FME Flow?</p>
<p>You can accomplish this using FME Flow Workspace Apps. You can create a Workspace App by clicking on Flow Apps from the FME Flow Menu:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eF0iIP8WtQBYB-R5rgeGbwxGcZoWzU4IY6wtY1-2u0G0xC-1Yw6c6g4HxsbVdof7P6oK92iyCzt7fmPGtENrdnQVD40tR0vMGGDNfVUlz-EEcS-PFaNiuB_qwM9LzyHZ6kqKHvDHxzTAVWcl" alt="Server Apps menu" width="227" height="244" /></p>
<p>To manage FME Flow Apps, click on Manage Workspace Apps. From here, you can manage all your existing apps and create new ones.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ZFbmsShdMTGvnQ_sY0eEzJYwewxJAEio-2JQAOy-MtraKGV0Qvn8MkXNGz0NqHnE3XU2jnABpZcWxI0-w_dJD0XszsIRWLL-VjNqp1_C6ZA8M4proU3uv44RihxrvgWxe9AWahYLSe6ubTji" alt="Flow Apps list" width="1177" height="267" /></p>
<p>When creating a new Workspace App, you will be able to select which workspace you would like your app to run and also set an expiration date for the app. The expiration date is helpful if you would like to temporarily share the app and then disable it after a set period of time.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mh1l2p2uDIsw64-vPmnUog6ICrTz4pxVLVEYDgULQM3-nH99mEa7DVWp2zwbjvaR0ToNf61mPodFrHZHOIeV7-TNn7inIlm2fwcvHOO7R9DL2L0HRTya7LIla8LmWcBZeSD_yLo5IsRfTOEB" alt="Create Workspace App page" width="1079" height="710" /></p>
<p>Next, you can select which Published Parameters you would like to be displayed for your end-users to set when they use your Workspace App:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bj30mkbPH686pQ-79sw4ntQn9evrW21KtHK3vEP9O8WPf2RMiqe05Q0FLHr-kolSf8yKEpqBCbPtr0Cl1yXxo8pjuLM0iib91dcZCgGgtt9JugViLPhJvU6zEeBzbIfTpTVwpdr3Jqa5hj6" alt="Setting Published Parameters for a workspace app" width="1103" height="625" /></p>
<p>And finally, you can customize the appearance of your Flow App by changing the background color and adding logos, icons, and banners.</p>
<p>FME Flow will then generate a Workspace App URL. Anyone with that URL can run the app you created but may have to log into FME Flow first is Require Authentication was selected.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/K6MGHbX5Kbt3NYm0NBc5czlmKDAUElD-ACJSWYawOMa5ehbMlXjOtCP2-Q3OcMJPUeRrgZeWmGwUkUd8guqUDL19yo4PaXPhxLmzhyP9-_s7OewWjGpi4Y7E7KrQXhz2TeLPC6Pphfa4KXO3" alt="FME Flow Workspace App URL" width="1057" height="734" /></p>
<p>The FME Flow Workspace App link will open a simplified Run Workspace page:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/f3WGhDrp8JQQ3Kxd4oz5gAl_DwxE97NDiEeomTK2pysObRtfNtESzi2EOff0sQRG_wNeejQ6Iy9f4s7TATL5OZqWTepMae5UgO6-0SDQjfIRG41jZdjIT4Mus7rAnlMTCkWACqEdXYkL0wp1" alt="FME Training Demo App" width="927" height="622" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="https://safemytrailhead.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">You can also create an FME Flow Workspace App from the Run Workspace page for any workspace by clicking on Workspace Actions &gt; Create Workspace App or from under the Advanced parameters section. This handy shortcut will directly open the Create Workspace FME Flow App page and automatically select the Workspace for you.</span></p>
</blockquote>

<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="https://safemytrailhead.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Gallery Apps act as landing pages for several Workspace Apps and URLs. You can fully customize them to suit your organization's needs without coding!

</blockquote>
<h2 id="webhook-url">Webhook URL</h2>
<p>Webhooks allow an application to run a workspace programmatically. You can create a Webhook URL for any workspace from the Run Workspace page. Webhooks help you build web applications that access FME Flow services because you can copy the HTTP request and embed it on your website or a 3rd party application. You could also embed the URL into an email, or paste the URL directly into a web browser.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="https://safemytrailhead.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p>For more information on Webhooks, see <a href="https://support.safe.com/hc/en-us/articles/25407742962189-Working-with-FME-and-Webhooks" target="_self">Working with FME and Webhooks. </a><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Later in the course, we will also discuss Webhook URLs.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="fme-server-rest-api">FME Flow REST API</h2>
<p>In more advanced use cases, you can also share the results of workspaces with users who don't have an FME Flow account using the FME Flow REST API. You can make an API call to FME Flow to run a workspace and include the results in your external applications.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="https://safemytrailhead.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">The webhook URL can use the FME Flow services (Data Download, Data Streaming), whereas the REST API can only submit jobs using the REST service,&nbsp;which acts similarly to the Job Submitter service. You can see </span><a style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://fme.safe.com/demos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demos using the FME Flow REST API</a><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><a style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_REST/apidoc/v3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read the documentation</a><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Share Content Through Projects</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Projects are used to bring together FME Flow items into groups that share a common solution, or 'project', in your organization. By grouping items in projects, you can reference them in one easy place and can include just about any&nbsp;<span class="mc-variable ProductNames.ProductName-FMEFlow variable">FME&nbsp;Flow</span>&nbsp;object you create or upload.</span></p>
<p>The main advantage of using projects is that they facilitate the easy transfer of configurations between FME hosts. This transfer is essential when migrating through various stages of development (such as from development, testing, to production servers).</p>
<p>In the previous section, you learned how to share single items through the web UI and webhooks, and now you will learn how to share multiple components simultaneously. Compiling a project will allow you to package up all the required workspaces, repositories, files, and other components in a single file similar to a zip folder. You can share the project file with other users within a Flow instance or export it to other Flow instances.</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">About Encryption</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Encryption was introduced to FME Flow in 2023.1 and is something to be aware of when creating, importing, and exporting projects. The default encryption mode setting is &ldquo;Standard,&rdquo; which applies a custom encryption key specific to your FME Flow installation. </span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://safemytrailhead.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/safe_note.png" alt="" width="63" height="64" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are using a Safe Software-provided machine for the Flow Authoring course the Flow Instance will be set to "Weak." </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For more information please see our </span><a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Flow/WebUI/Encryption.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">System Encryption Documentation</span></a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Creating the project</span></h3>
<p>From the side menu, click Projects, and you will be taken to the Manage Projects screen. To open a dialogue for a new project, click on the &ldquo;Create Project&rdquo; heading in the menu or the blue &ldquo;Create&rdquo; button on the page.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><img src="images/1725051108819.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>First, you need to give your project a name, which will be the file's name if it is exported and imported. A description is also required and will be the text displayed under the &ldquo;Description&rdquo; heading in Manage Projects.</p>
<p><img src="images/1725051136239.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Scroll down on this page to the next heading of &ldquo;Project Contents&rdquo;. When creating a new project, this area will be empty and you will need to click &ldquo;Add Items&rdquo; to open a new window.</p>
<p><img src="images/1725051156418.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Add Items&rdquo; window, there is an &ldquo;Item Type&rdquo; drop-down menu where you can select which item types to display to aid your search. Below is an example where I selected the &ldquo;Workspace&rdquo; item type. I can select the repository where the workspace is located and then click the blue + icon to add it to the project.</p>
<p><img src="images/1725051182787.png" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://safemytrailhead.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/safe_note.png" alt="" width="63" height="64" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some items, such as tokens and workspace apps, can only be included if you are the owner. Permissions for other roles can be set accordingly to allow access to items you do not own. For more information,&nbsp;please see </span><a style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://support.safe.com/hc/en-us/articles/25407725018893-Getting-Started-With-FME-Flow-Projects">Getting Started with FME Flow Projects.</a></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">There are many item types available; you'll learn more about them later in the <a href="https://academy.safe.com/path/fme-flow-authoring" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FME Flow Authoring learning path</a>.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you have added all the items required, click &ldquo;Add Items." You will then see these items in &ldquo;Project Contents.&rdquo; If an item you have added requires files, connections, or tokens to run, these are listed as Dependencies, and will be automatically included in the project.</p>

<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exporting the project</span></h3>
<p>Click the checkbox next to the &ldquo;Name&rdquo; column and select the &ldquo;Export&rdquo; button. Alternatively, you can open the project by clicking on the Name and selecting Export from the drop-down menu. To allow others to import the project to any other Flow instance without the encryption key, uncheck the box" &ldquo;Include sensitive information&rdquo; box.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="images/1725051258301.png" alt="" /></span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Importing a project</span></h3>
<p>To import a project file, click the Import button on the Manage Projects screen. Choose Upload if the project file is on your computer or Resources if it's already on FME Flow.</p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400; font-size: 16pt;">Quick Import vs Import</span></h4>
<p>There are two methods of importing a project: quick import and import. The quick import option will simply take everything in the project file and put it in the right location. This is a good option if the project file only contains a few items and you want to import them all.</p>
<p><img src="images/1725051292035.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The Import button will preview all items in the project and allow you to deselect items if you wish to exclude them. You might not want to overwrite files of the same name or for other reasons.</p>
<p>Here we can see an example of a project that contains items I already have on my FME Flow. Clicking the &ldquo;Allow items to be overwritten if they already exist&rdquo; toggle will allow FME Flow to overwrite those items with new ones from the project.</p>
