<p>Learning content in the FME Academy presents a user's story addressing their data integration challenges with FME.&nbsp;<strong>You should follow along with their actions using your installation of FME (2025.0.1 or later) </strong>or request an on-demand virtual machine in the footer link below. Some lessons will require you to follow their steps or take additional steps to answer a quiz question.</p>

<h2>Navigating to FME Flow</h2>
<p><img class="image image-block" src="images/sven.png" alt="Sven" width="234" height="249" /></p>
<p>Sven works as a Planning Analyst for a city&rsquo;s Economic Development department. The city recently set up its FME Flow, and Sven is navigating FME Flow for the first time. Eventually, Sven will deploy his current FME workflows on FME Flow, but he needs to log in and understand how to use the FME Flow user interface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sven's FME Flow administrator has given him his FME Flow credentials and explained how to navigate to FME Flow.</p>
<p>Sven can access FME Flow through the URL<span style="color: #e03e2d;"> <strong>http://&lt;FMEFlowHostname&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/fmeserver<span style="color: #000000;">.&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: #000000;">The port may be optional, depending on the FME Flow deployment architecture.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #e03e2d;"><span style="color: #000000;">On the machine where you deployed FME Flow, Sven can open the Start menu, expand the FME Flow folder, and click the shortcut to the FME Flow Web Interface. Optionally, Sven can open <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>http://localhost/</strong><span style="color: #000000;">, which</span><strong> </strong><span style="color: #000000;">will also open FME Flow in the web browser on the FME Flow machine.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><img src="images/1748461537981.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>FME Flow will open to the login page in the web browser. Sven inputs his credentials and logs in to FME Flow.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p>If you're taking a Safe Software-hosted training course, you can access FME Flow at <strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;">http://localhost</span></strong> and the FME Flow login credentials are <strong><span style="color: #000000;">username: </span></strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>admin </strong><span style="color: #000000;">and&nbsp;<strong>password:&nbsp;<span style="color: #e03e2d;">FMElearnings</span></strong><span style="color: #e03e2d;"><span style="color: #000000;">.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;If you are not taking a Safe Software-hosted course and you have just installed FME Flow and haven't logged in yet, you must use the default username/password, admin/admin, to log in. After entering the default credentials, you will need to create a new password for the admin user account. Then log in using the username admin and your new password. Because this is a fresh install, you will also have to license FME Flow before continuing; see the <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Flow/AdminGuide/Request_and_Install_a_License-Express-Windows.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FME Flow Licensing Walk-Through</a>.</p>
<p>If you are using FME Flow Hosted, see <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme-flow-hosted/FME-Flow-Hosted/Content/About_Instances/Connect_to_Web_UI.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these instructions</a>.</p>

<h2>FME Flow Dashboard</h2>
<p>Upon logging in, the FME Flow home page Dashboard opens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Across the top, there are shortcuts to FME Flow functions. The main part of the page provides an overview of recent activity, including the latest published workspaces, updated items, job requests, and Automations. Sven can click on any of these items to open them on FME Flow quickly. Since Sven is an admin, he can access almost all content and functionality on FME Flow. If he does not have permission to access other users' content, he will only see an overview of his own items on the FME Flow Dashboard. On the right side of the Dashboard, Sven can access his favorite items and links to helpful FME resources.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p>You control FME Flow permissions through User Management. To learn more about managing users, roles, and permissions, see our FME Flow documentation on <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Flow/WebUI/User-Management.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">User Management</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>FME Flow Menu</h2>
<p>On the left side of FME Flow, Sven examines the menu that allows him to navigate to all the different functions of FME Flow. Sven can click the FME Flow logo at the top to bring him back to the Dashboard anytime.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Help &amp; Resources&nbsp;<img src="images/tooltip.png" width="40" /></h2>
<p>Sven sees the Help &amp; Resources button in the top-right corner of FME Flow. He clicks on it and sees its options lead to many pages with help and support for FME Flow and the FME Flow REST API. Sven makes note of these because the resources will be extremely useful to him as he continues using FME Flow.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>Follow Sven's steps to open the FME Flow login page in a web browser, log in using your FME Flow credentials, and explore the FME Flow home page and menu options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How you log in will depend on which FME Flow instance you are using.</p>
<p><strong>Safe Software-hosted Training Course</strong></p>
<p>If you are taking a Safe Software-hosted training course, you can access FME Flow at&nbsp;<a href="http://localhost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost/</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Username: <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>admin</strong></span></li>
<li>Password: <span style="color: #e03e2d;"><strong>FMElearnings</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>A Brand-New FME Flow Instance</strong></p>
<p>If you are not taking a Safe Software-hosted course, have just installed your FME Flow, and haven&rsquo;t logged in yet, you must use the default username/password, admin/admin.</p>
<div class="box message info">
<div class="inner">
<div class="bd">
<div class="media">
<div class="mediaBd">
<div class="message-media-content">
<p>After entering the default username/password, FME Flow will prompt you to create a new password for the admin user account. Then log in using the username admin and your new password. Because this is a fresh install, you must also license FME Flow before continuing; see the <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Flow/AdminGuide/Request_and_Install_a_License-Express-Windows.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FME Flow Licensing Walk-Through</a>&nbsp;for instructions.</p>
