<p>After completing this lesson, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand how to share multiple components with project files</li>
<li>Import a project to FME Flow</li>
<li>Understand how project dependencies work in FME Flow</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h2>Importing a Project</h2>
<p>Clicking the Import button from the Manage Projects page will open FME Flow's project import options. You may Upload an .fsproject file from your computer or import it from the Resources on FME Flow.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/1750862343652.jpg" alt="" width="820" height="393" /></p>
<p>After you select a project, you have two options: Quick Import or Import.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Quick Import</h4>
<p>Quick Import skips any configuration steps for project contents, such as including or excluding sensitive data like tokens or connections. You only have the option to overwrite items if they already exist or to exclude those items from being imported into the project. You may want to use this option if you know all items in the project and want to import all of them, including any sensitive data.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/1750862526154.jpg" alt="" width="994" height="296" /></p>
<h4>Import</h4>
<p>The Import option previews all items in the project and allows you to deselect dependencies if you wish to exclude them before importing the project.</p>
<p>The first step, Preview Content, lists all items in the project, and you must decide whether to overwrite existing items on your FME Flow.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/1750823543300.jpg" alt="" width="970" height="601" /></p>
<p>The next step, Choose Items, allows you to import items excluded from the import by default. These items, like connections and tokens, may disrupt workflows if you overwrite them.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/1750862850869.jpg" alt="" width="1048" height="481" /></p>
<p>You only need to complete the Resolve Owners step if the user who owns items in the project does not exist on the FME Flow to which you add the project. If the user does not exist, you must reassign the items to a user to take ownership of the items.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under Additional Options, you may disable items you do not want to run or use immediately after import completion. For example, an Automation may immediately begin running if it is enabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/1750863125376.jpg" alt="" width="1067" height="707" /></p>
<p>Whether you select Import or Quick Import, the last step is completing the import. Once you click Import Project, FME Flow imports the items and displays the import status.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Testing your workflows after migrating them between FME Flow instances is always a good idea. After a successful import, you will see the newly added project items among the existing content on your FME Flow.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p>To import a project that you exported with sensitive data, you must ensure the encryption keys match between the FME Flow instances; otherwise, the project import will fail. For more information on System Encryption and Projects, see <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Flow/WebUI/Exporting-Importing-Projects.htm" target="_self">our documentation</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exercise</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="images/1750822388120.png" alt="" width="222" height="236" /><img src="images/1750822416478.png" alt="" width="223" height="236" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sven has been busy creating workflows ready to be deployed on the city's production FME Flow. He has developed and exported a project from Planning's development FME Flow and sent it to Frank to import onto the production FME Flow instance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow along with Frank as he imports Sven's project into FME Flow.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">1) Import Project</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank opens Projects on FME Flow and clicks Import to import Sven's project.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="images/1750822850473.jpg" alt="" width="1392" height="630" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frank keeps the File Location setting as Upload and then adds <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData/Workspaces/DeployWorkflowsWithFMEFlow/import-projects--starting-project.fsproject" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sven's project</a> (C:\FMEData\Workspaces\DeployWorkflowsWithFMEFlow\import-projects--starting-project.fsproject) to the Project File. He does not alter the topic settings and clicks Import.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="images/1750823064039.jpg" alt="" width="744" height="541" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first step of Project Import is to Preview Content. Frank sees that most of Sven's project items are New Items; however, the DataValidation Workspace App and its dependencies already exist on FME Flow.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="images/1750823373976.jpg" alt="" width="948" height="516" /></span></p>
<p>Frank doesn't want to overwrite the existing DataValidation App, or the workspace, repository, and token FME Flow includes as dependencies, so Frank deselects the option to overwrite existing items.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/1750823543300.jpg" alt="" width="970" height="601" /></p>
<p>Frank scrolls to the bottom and clicks Continue to go to the next step.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following two steps - Choose Items and Resolve Owners - do not require any configurations, so Frank clicks Continue to proceed to Additional Options. Frank scrolls to the bottom of the page and clicks Import Project.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/1750823762527.jpg" alt="" width="970" height="265" /></p>
<p>The project immediately begins to import. Once the import completes, FME Flow displays the Project Import status.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/1750823913980.jpg" alt="" width="1021" height="204" /></p>
<h3>2) Test Running an Imported Workspace</h3>
<p>Now that Frank has imported the project, he will test running one of Sven's workspaces to ensure it runs successfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frank goes to the Run Workspace page&nbsp;and configures the FloodRiskProject.fmw workspace in the Planning repository to run.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/1750824061295.jpg" alt="" width="664" height="450" /></p>
<p>Frank does not alter any of the Published Parameter default values, scrolls to the bottom of the page, and clicks Run.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/1750824213260.jpg" alt="" width="813" height="221" /></p>
<p>Sven's FloodRiskProject.fmw workspace runs successfully on FME Flow.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/1750824299353.jpg" alt="" width="915" height="236" /></p>
<p>Frank has successfully imported Sven's project to their city's production FME Flow environment.&nbsp;</p>
