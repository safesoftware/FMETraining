<h3>Scenario 3: Raster Crop and Highlight Tool</h3>
<p>Jennifer is creating a tool for an environmental analysis team that frequently works with large aerial imagery (e.g., orthophotos). They want an FME workspace that crops a section of the imagery based on geometry input and highlights certain features or regions by applying a custom colour overlay. Jennifer has built the transformers of the workspace and is now working on the parameters to take user input.&nbsp;</p>
