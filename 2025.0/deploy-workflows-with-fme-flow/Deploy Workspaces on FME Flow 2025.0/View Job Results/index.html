<h2 id="learning-objectives">Learning Objectives</h2>
<p>After completing this lesson, you&rsquo;ll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>View jobs in different states on FME Flow.</li>
<li>View the log from a completed job.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData/Workspaces/DeployWorkflowsWithFMEFlow/publish-a-workspace-to-fme-flow.fmw" target="_self">Starting workspace</a> | <span style="font-weight: 400;">C:\FMEData\Workspaces\DeployWorkflowsWithFMEFlow\publish-a-workspace-to-fme-flow.fmw</span></li>
</ul>
<h2>Viewing Job Results</h2>
<p>After running a workspace on FME Flow, you can see the translation status from the Run Workspace page. You may also click on View Details to open Jobs and view more information about the job.</p>
<p><img src="images/1750292741934.jpg" alt="" width="1005" height="344" /></p>
<p>The detailed Jobs page shows more information about the translation and contains expandable sections with even more information. The Status section contains simple statistics about the job. Request Data includes information the FME Flow core passes to the FME Engines to carry out the job request, while Result Data is information about the translation result the Engine passes back to the FME Flow Core.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/1747234415434.jpg" alt="" width="1108" height="463" /></p>
<p>The next section of the page shows the job log. For a completed translation, you see the same information in a job log on FME Flow as in the translation log in FME Workbench.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/1745869491752.jpg" alt="" width="1202" height="531" /></p>
<p>The buttons at the top right allow you to filter job logs for errors, warnings, and informative messages.</p>
<h2>View All Jobs</h2>
<p>If you're no longer on the completed Run Workspace page and wish to view job details, you can view all recent jobs from the Jobs page. If you click on a job, the same detailed view opens as from View Details on the completed Run Workspace page.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/1745870024929.jpg" alt="" width="1370" height="535" /></p>
<p>The Jobs page shows information about each workspace translation, such as the job ID number, the workspace name, the user who ran it, and the job source, such as Automations or Flow Apps. The Customize Columns button on the right side allows you to select and change which data fields are displayed in the Jobs view.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also filter jobs by various criteria to find specific job information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/1745870231043.jpg" alt="" width="851" height="436" /></p>
<p>Across the top, you may view jobs currently in the Queued or Running state. If a job is queued, it waits for an available engine to process the translation. The Running section shows jobs that an engine is currently processing. The list will be empty if no jobs are currently in either of these states.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>In the last exercise, Sven ran his workspace on FME Flow and saw that it completed successfully. Although the workspace ran successfully, Sven should know where to access more detailed job information for monitoring, development, and troubleshooting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow along with Sven as he views the job log for the job he ran in the previous exercise.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="1-find-published-workspace">1) View Job Details</h3>
<p>In FME Flow, Sven clicks Jobs on the left side menu. The Completed Jobs tab opens, and he clicks on the latest job that ran the publish-a-workspace-to-fme-flow.fmw workspace to open the job information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="images/1745876539945.jpg" alt="" width="1193" height="366" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p>If Sven was still on the Run Workspace page, he could click View Details to open the job information alternatively to navigating through the Jobs page.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sven's job completed successfully; however, if it failed, this would be the best place to look for information about what went wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="2-configure-parameters">2) Inspect Job</h3>
<p>Sven expands the Status, Request Data, and Result Data tabs and inspects the job log to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How many features were written by the job?</li>
<li>Which Queue was the job submitted to? (Hint: Expand the Request Data tab.)</li>
<li>What status did the job complete as?&nbsp; (Hint: Expand the Result Data tab.)</li>
<li>How many error entries are present in the job log?&nbsp;</li>
<li>How many total features were read by the workspace? (Hint: Navigate to the Features Read Summary near the end of the job log.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember the answers to these questions - you'll need some of them to complete the quiz!&nbsp;</p>
