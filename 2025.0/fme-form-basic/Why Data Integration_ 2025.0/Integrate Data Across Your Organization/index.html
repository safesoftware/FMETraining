</div>
</details><details>
<summary><strong>Workspace</strong></summary>
<div>
<p>Workspaces are files (ending in .fmw) that you create in FME Workbench that define all of the parameters of your data integration workflow.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a background using other data integration tools, workspaces are similar to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Programmers: scripts or pipelines.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GIS professionals: ModelBuilder models.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note: </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">these are not called &ldquo;workbenches,&rdquo; which is a common misconception.</span></p>
</div>
</details><details>
<summary><strong>Transformer</strong></summary>
<div>
<p>The building blocks used in a workflow in FME Workbench. Each transformer has a specific function. They can be used alone in a simple workspace or combined to create complex processes.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a background using other data integration tools, transformers are similar to:</span></p>
<ul>

<summary><strong>Schema</strong></summary>
<div>
<p>A schema is a formal definition of a dataset&rsquo;s structure, including table names, attribute names, and attribute data types (e.g., text, integer, float). With spatial data, the geometry type (point, line, polygon, etc.) is also considered part of the&nbsp;schema. You might also hear this referred to as a data model.</p>
</div>
</details>
<h2>Learning Path</h2>
<p>You will learn the FME essentials throughout this learning path by completing hands-on problem-solving exercises. You will learn how FME helps you integrate data through three phases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connect&nbsp;data and applications</li>
<li>Transform&nbsp;data to fit your needs</li>
<li>Automate&nbsp;workflows to run when you need them</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/1769105216970.png" alt="Connect, Transform, Automate" /></p>
<p>By the end of the learning path, you will be ready to author and deploy your own FME data integration workflows.</p>
<h2>FME Platform</h2>
<p><img src="images/1769040087661.png" alt="FME platform products" /></p>
<p>The FME platform comprises several products that you use together to achieve enterprise integration.</p>

<div>FME Form is a desktop application and the FME Platform's no-code authoring environment for creating all data workflows.</div>
<div>FME Form comprises a number of complementary applications. The main application you'll use is called<strong> FME Workbench</strong>. It is the authoring environment for the FME platform. You'll use it to create data integration workflows using a drag-and-drop, visual system.</div>

<div><em>Where Your Solutions Are Delivered</em></div>
<div>FME Flow is a server-based application where you deploy your workflows and use them in automations, no-code web apps, and more.</div>
<div>Once you have authored a workflow in FME Workbench, you can run it whenever you need to, including using Windows Task Scheduler/chron jobs or the command line. But once you are ready to take your data integration automation to the next level, you can publish your workflow to FME Flow. FME Flow is a server-based application that you deploy yourself. FME Flow administrators can setup security and access rules for all your data and integrations, as well as orchestrate jobs to provide maximum efficiency for your use cases.</div>

<h2 id="starting-an-fme-project">Starting an FME Project</h2>
<p><img class="image image-block" src="images/sven.png" alt="Sven" width="256" height="256" /></p>
<p>Sven works as a Planning Analyst for a city&rsquo;s economic development department. He has been given an <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-ReadersWriters/xlsx/xlsx.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Excel</a> spreadsheet containing the&nbsp;point locations of businesses and needs to load it into an&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-ReadersWriters/geodatabase/geodatabase.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Esri geodatabase</a>. He will use this business data to create guides for each city neighborhood to provide to residents, prospective business owners, and tourists.</p>
<h2 id="connect-to-your-data">Starting Data</h2>
<p>Sven is starting with an Excel workbook (<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData/Data/Planning/BusinessOwners.xlsx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BusinessOwners.xlsx</a>) with a single sheet. Each row is a separate business and contains information about the business, including the owner's name, the company's name, the business license number, and the location of the business&rsquo;s primary address. He wants to keep all this information in his new geodatabase.</p>
<h2 id="connect-to-your-data"></h2>
<p><img src="images/1769625554442.png" alt="Excel to Esri Geodatabase" width="960" height="540" /></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find out how he can solve this data integration problem with FME through the steps of connect, transform, and automate.</p>
<h2 id="connect">Connect</h2>
<p>Sven uses the desktop authoring software <strong>FME Workbench</strong>, the primary application in FME Form, to build a <strong>workspace&nbsp;</strong>that will integrate his data. Workspaces are the definition of a data integration workflow.</p>
<p>He adds objects representing the source and destination datasets to the visual drag-and-drop interface in FME Workbench:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1713301297888.png" alt="Connecting data" width="424" height="44" /></p>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t have to write a single line of code.</p>
<h2 id="transform">Transform</h2>
<p>Next, Sven adds objects called <strong><a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-Form/Workbench/transforming-data.htm" target="_self">transformers</a> </strong>to his workspace to change his data to meet the destination requirements. He uses transformers to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Edit the data&rsquo;s <strong>schema</strong>, changing the attribute names and data types&nbsp;to match the geodatabase schema</li>
<li>Enrich the data by joining information from an external PostgreSQL database table.</li>
<li>Filter out records that don't belong in the destination location.</li>
</ul>
<p>First, he adds an AttributeManager transformer to ensure his attributes meet the requirements of the geodatabase:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1769540236967.png" alt="Using a transformer" width="541" height="120" /></p>
<p>He adds more transformers one-by-one until his workspace looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/1769540255368.png" alt="Sven's complete workspace" width="948" height="170" /></p>
<p>He runs his workspace and FME reads the data from the Excel workbook, transforms it, and writes it to the Esri geodatabase.</p>
<h2 id="automate">Automate</h2>
<p>If Sven only needed to integrate this data once, he would just run his workspace in FME Workbench, and he&rsquo;s done. However, he needs to send his data to a colleague regularly, so he publishes his workspace to <a href="https://fme.safe.com/platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FME Flow</a>.</p>
<p>With FME Flow, he builds an Automation to run his workspace once a month. If the workspace succeeds, FME Flow emails the results to his colleague. If it fails, FME Flow emails Sven to alert him so he can investigate.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1769456472245.png" alt="FME Flow automation" width="524" height="320" /></p>
<p>Now Sven's colleague will stay up-to-date without needing to bother him.</p>
<p>Over the rest of this course, we'll work through these steps to help Sven build this workspace and automation.</p>
