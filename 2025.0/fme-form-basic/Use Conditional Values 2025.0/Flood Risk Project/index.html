<p>Jennifer is working on a workspace to calculate the tsunami flood risk for all addresses in the city. The flood risk score combines closeness to the shoreline and elevation above sea level. It is on a scale from one to five (1-5) and is calculated using this table:</p>
<table class="featureTable sort_table">
<tbody class="tbody">
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td colspan="3"><strong>Elevation (meters above sea level)</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td align="center"><em>0-10m</em></td>
<td align="center"><em>10-25m</em></td>
<td align="center"><em>25-60m</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="3"><strong>Distance from Shoreline (meters)</strong></td>
<td align="center"><em>100m</em></td>
<td align="center">1</td>
<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><em>200m</em></td>
<td align="center">2</td>
<td align="center">3</td>
<td align="center">4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><em>300m</em></td>
<td align="center">3</td>
<td align="center">4</td>
<td align="center">5</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>She has built the workspace so that each address has an elevation and distance from the shoreline. Now, she wants to use conditional values to calculate the flood risk score.</p>
<h2>1) Start Workbench</h2>
<p>Jennifer opens the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData/Workspaces/TransformAttributes/exercise-flood-risk-project.fmw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starting workspace</a> (C:\FMEData\Workspaces\TransformAttributes\exercise-flood-risk-project.fmw).</p>
<p>She turns on feature caching and runs the workspace.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p>You will get an <a href="https://support.safe.com/hc/en-us/articles/25407674781453-Unexpected-Input-Remover" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unexpected Input dialog</a>, but you can ignore it. FME shows this dialog when it reads features in the source dataset that do not have a feature type defined on the canvas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To observe the data, she inspects all three CoastalZones [GML] reader feature type caches and the AttributeRenamer's Output cache (Ctrl or ⌘-click).</p>
<p><img class="image" src="images/1714593768184.png" alt="Flood risk zones and addresses" width="744" height="605" /></p>
<p>This colored screenshot shows how the addresses fall within (and are assigned) a zone denoting their distance from the shoreline. They also possess an elevation value. Jennifer must now use this information to assign a flood risk to each address.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">As with most FME projects, there are multiple ways to carry out this task. The two primary techniques are </span><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">conditional filtering</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">data mapping</strong><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Conditional filtering means separating the data according to the elevation and shoreline zone. Data mapping means we set an attribute value (flood risk) according to the value of other attributes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Here is an example of how we might mix filtering data by coastal zone with mapping data by elevation:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;"><img src="images/1714593753221.png" width="586" height="466" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">However, we can avoid filtering data by using Conditional Values. The filter conditions are incorporated as the conditions for our Conditional Values.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>2) Finish Configuring AttributeManager</h2>
<p>Jennifer added an AttributeManager in the starting workspace after the AttributeRenamer.</p>
<p>She inspects the AttributeManager parameters. Ignoring the existing attributes, she scrolls to the bottom of the dialog and finds the <code>FloodRisk</code> attribute.</p>
<p>She has already begun configuring a conditional value but needs to finish it. In the Attribute Value field, she clicks the drop-down arrow and chooses <strong>Conditional Value</strong>:</p>
<p><img class="image" src="images/1714593777820.png" alt="Selecting Conditional Value..." width="973" height="447" /></p>
<p>This opens a new dialog similar to a Tester/TestFilter transformer. It has fields for Test Condition and Output Value.</p>
<p>Jennifer has already configured the dialog to map the conditions for where FloodRisk=1 (the highest). According to the table of calculations, this can occur only where Zone = 100 AND Elevation &lt;= 10. Jennifer has configured the Test to use the Boolean operator AND to ensure both conditions are true:</p>
<p><img src="images/1714593788310.png" alt="Condition Statement with four outcomes" width="614" height="566" /></p>
<p>She needs to finish configuring the dialog with the case for FloodRisk = 5.</p>
<p>She double-clicks the cell in the Test column to the right of the gray Else If text to add a new Test. Clicking opens a Tester-like dialog:</p>
<p><img class="image" src="images/1718049057574.png" alt="Defining the first test" width="587" height="348" /></p>
<p>She configures the dialog as follows. She remembers to specify the output Value (5) below the Test Clauses area:</p>
<p><img class="image" src="images/1714594255440.png" alt="Defining Logic and setting the Attribute Value" width="453" height="354" /></p>
<p>She clicks <strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;to close this part of the dialog.</p>
<p>The main Conditional Definition dialog is complete. It should look like this:</p>
<p><img class="image" src="images/1714594267209.png" alt="Dialog with remaining tests entered" width="614" height="566" /></p>
<p>It is essential to keep these in the correct order; otherwise, a feature may pass the tests in the wrong order and receive a lower risk than expected.</p>
<p>Jennifer accepts the changes, and the main AttributeManager dialog now looks like this:</p>
<p><img class="image" src="images/1714594276849.png" alt="FloodRisk with 6 possible values" width="724" height="207" /></p>
<h2>3) Add Inspector</h2>
<p>Jennifer would like to separate the data into layers for easier inspection. She can accomplish this with an Inspector transformer with a Group By setting. She places a single Inspector transformer connected to the AttributeManager's Output port.</p>
<p>She opens the Inspector parameters dialog, checks Group Processing, and sets Group By to the newly created FloodRisk attribute.</p>
<p>She saves and runs the workspace. She sees each address colored to match its flood risk. She can adjust the feature symbology to produce a better result, like so:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block" src="images/1714594293372.png" alt="Result with five flood risk groups of address points" width="1061" height="498" /></p>
<p>She can also turn off each zone by clicking the checkboxes in Display Control to see which addresses are most/least at risk.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Best practices should always play a part in any workspace. Using conditional values usually means fewer transformers on the canvas, but does this improve the workspace? Is it a more aesthetic (good-looking) workspace? The decision on which method to use may depend on who will maintain the workspace. In most cases, conditional filters or data mapping are both valid options. If you "hide" a lot of logic in a Conditional Value calculation, call it out by attaching an annotation. Summary annotation is particularly useful, since it will automatically update if you change the logic.</span></p>
