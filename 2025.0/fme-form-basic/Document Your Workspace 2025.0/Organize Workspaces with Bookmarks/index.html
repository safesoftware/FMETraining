<h2 id="why-use-bookmarks">Why Use Bookmarks?</h2>
<p>Like its real-world namesake, a bookmark is a means of putting a marker down for easy access.</p>
<p>With FME, the bookmark covers an area of the workspace that usually carries out a specific task, so a user can pick it out of a broader set of transformers and move to it with relative ease.</p>
<p>Bookmarks make your workspace more straightforward to understand and navigate.</p>
<h2 id="adding-a-bookmark">Adding a Bookmark</h2>
<p>To add a bookmark, click the Bookmark icon on the toolbar.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1716848676522.png" alt="Bookmark button on the Toolbar" width="397" height="62" /></p>
<p>Whereas a traditional bookmark marks a single page in a book, an FME bookmark can cover a wide canvas area. You can divide a single workspace into different sections by applying multiple bookmarks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">If you create a bookmark while objects are selected, the bookmark automatically expands to include those items.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="resizing-and-editing-a-bookmark">Resizing and Editing a Bookmark</h2>
<p>To resize a bookmark, hover over a corner or edge and drag the cursor to change its size or shape.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1716848864685.png" alt="Expanding a bookmark" width="238" height="239" /></p>
<p><strong>Bookmark Properties</strong></p>
<p>Click the cogwheel icon on a bookmark header to open the bookmark properties dialog:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1716848970065.png" alt="Changing bookmark color" width="512" height="267" /></p>
<p>Here, you can change the bookmark's name and color and decide whether the contents will move (more on that later).</p>
<p>You can set bookmark colors to an existing color palette or use custom colors. Additionally, you can create customized palettes by going to Tools &gt; FME Options... &gt; Appearance:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1716849036230.png" alt="Changing default palettes" width="510" height="327" /></p>
<p>You can use the context (right-click) menu for a bookmark or the mini-toolbar icon to disable all its objects, making it useful for testing purposes:</p>

<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>To continue improving her workspace, Jennifer needs to add bookmarks.</p>
<h2>1) Open Workspace</h2>
<p>She opens the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData/Workspaces/UseDataIntegrationBestPractices/organize-workspaces-with-bookmarks.fmw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starting workspace</a> (C:\FMEData\Workspaces\UseDataIntegrationBestPractices\organize-workspaces-with-bookmarks.fmw) with FME Workbench (2025.0.1 or later).</p>
<h2>2) Add First Bookmark</h2>
<p>Jennifer first identifies areas of her workspace she'd like to group together.</p>
<p>The group of attribute management transformers near the beginning of the workspace is a good candidate for a bookmark, as those transformers all conduct similar functions before the data is ready to join.</p>
<p>She clicks and drags to select these five transformers:</p>
<p><img src="images/1747928862309.png" alt="Clicking and dragging to select multiple objects" /></p>
<p>Then she right-clicks any of the selected transformers and clicks Create Bookmark.</p>
<p><img src="images/1747928882543.png" alt="Create Bookmark" /></p>
<p>They are surrounded by a new bookmark, which she names "Prepare addresses to join" by simply typing and then hitting Enter:</p>
<p><img src="images/1747929071987.png" alt="New bookmark" /></p>
<h2>3) Add Remaining Bookmarks</h2>
<p>Help Jennifer by adding bookmarks in the rest of the workspace.</p>
<p>Try to follow these suggestions when grouping objects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Group by function - like with like</li>
<li>Group by their "step" in workspace processing</li>
<li>Group by their location in the workspace
<ul>
<li>Feel free to move transformers or reader feature types&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It's often a good idea to clearly distinguish reading and writing bookmarks
<ul>
<li>Some users like to have only one reading and one writing bookmark, and have those be the furthest left and furthest right bookmarks in the workspace, respectively</li>
<li>Some users like to use the default Reader/Writers color option for any transformer that contains feature types</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generally, try to include more than one object in each bookmark. That said, there's not a huge difference between adding annotation to a transformer that's not in a bookmark versus putting that single transformer in its own bookmark.
<ul>
<li>The pro to using annotation is you can more easily fit lots of text, because text in annotations can wrap.</li>
<li>The pro to using a small bookmark is it gives you room to expand on that section if you find you need more transformers there later.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generally, try to include every transformer in a bookmark.
<ul>
<li>If it has a very unique function, you could leave it out of a bookmark and add annotation instead.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once complete, your workspace should look something like this:</p>
