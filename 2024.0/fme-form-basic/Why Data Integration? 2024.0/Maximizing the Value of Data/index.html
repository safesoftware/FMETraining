<p>You will learn the FME essentials throughout this learning path by completing hands-on problem-solving exercises. You will learn how FME helps you integrate data through three phases:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Connect&nbsp;</strong>data and applications</li>
<li><strong>Transform&nbsp;</strong>data to fit your needs</li>
<li><strong>Automate&nbsp;</strong>workflows to run when you need them</li>
</ul>
<p>By the end of the learning path, you will be ready to create your own FME data integration workflows.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-down-data-silos">Breaking Down Data Silos</h2>
<p>Data integration helps address the following challenges faced by many organizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data silos and separate software systems make accessing data difficult.</li>
<li>Existing integration processes are manual and labor-intensive.</li>
<li>Poor data quality means wasting time on manual data cleaning.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://safemytrailhead.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/safe_note.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Data silo</strong>: data or databases that are maintained and used outside organization-wide data administration. Often they are associated with a single individual or department.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The City of Naperville, Illinois, automated 3300+ service requests and work orders in their first year using FME. They used FME to break down data silos across their Electric, Public Works, Finance, and Water departments while delivering more with less staff. They use FME to integrate several technologies, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cityworks for asset management</li>
<li>Excel for electric meter requests</li>
<li>PowerBI for dashboarding</li>
<li>ArcGIS Survey123 for service requests</li>
<li>ArcGIS Open Data</li>
</ul>
<p>Danielle DuBose, Database Developer in Naperville&rsquo;s IT department, says, &ldquo;Our customer experience has improved, and we have reduced department frustration through upgrading business processes with FME. It&rsquo;s been a game changer for us."</p>

<p>Removing data silos through data integration can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve data sharing and accessibility between internal teams and external vendors.</li>
<li>Enable faster and more accurate decision-making.</li>

<h2 id="the-value-of-spatial-data-integration">The Value of Spatial Data Integration</h2>
<p>To many, 'spatial data' translates directly to 'map.' Maps are a great way to display spatial data, but there is much more to spatial data than just maps. After all, everything we see and do has some spatial component. Where we live, how we travel - the list doesn&rsquo;t end.</p>
<p>We can learn more about why certain spatial relationships exist by analyzing spatial data and how certain variables impact our lives. Why are specific locations popular travel destinations? Why does a brand succeed in one country and not another? It&rsquo;s time to start adopting spatial and location data practices better to understand human behavior and our influence on the planet.</p>
<p>More and more organizations are producing and using spatial data. However, getting value out of that data through automating business processes and analyzing spatial patterns requires spatial data integration. Many data integration platforms exist, but FME provides the best support for spatial data integration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img src="https://safemytrailhead.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/safe_note.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Spatial data</strong>:&nbsp;data that is representative of a specific geographic location on the surface of the Earth.</p>
<p>Spatial data is often used with a&nbsp;<strong>geographic information system (GIS)</strong>,&nbsp;a system&nbsp;designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of&nbsp;spatial data.</p>
<p>If you are already familiar with spatial data, you can skip ahead to the Quiz.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://safemytrailhead.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/safe_note.png" /></p>
<p>Most of the workflows shown on the FME Academy use spatial data. However, FME treats data with geometry or without geometry largely the same, so the techniques you will learn will apply.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spatial data can be stored in vector or raster formats. Vector spatial data is made up of points, lines, and polygons. At its core, it consists of lists of coordinates on a plane and information regarding how they are connected.</p>
<p>Raster data comprises pixels, where the value (or color) of a pixel represents the value of a phenomenon, e.g., the average annual precipitation. Standard imagery uses the visible spectrum like a regular photograph. However, other kinds of imagery are available. For example, imagery in the near-infrared band can be used to measure the prevalence of vegetation beyond what the human eye can detect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Raster data is better for representing continuous data that varies over an entire area, such as elevation. Vector data is better for representing discrete objects, such as the outlines of buildings (polygons).</p>

<p>Spatial data contains geometry data that describes the actual location of the data. It also usually includes attribute data that describes the features. For example, here is a dataset of point locations of community centers that includes attributes such as &ldquo;CentreName&rdquo; and &ldquo;CentreAddress.&rdquo;</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1713817576570.png" alt="Community center points with attribute data" width="994" height="351" /></p>
<p>Having geometry and attributes in the same dataset lets you query or filter the data. For example, you could filter the dataset of community centers to select the point with a &ldquo;CentreName&rdquo; that equals &ldquo;Mount Pleasant.&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1713817588286.png" alt="Selecting a point" width="994" height="351" /></p>
<p>You can create maps or analyze patterns like clusters using spatial data. However, you must integrate it with other data sources to gain maximum value. For example, retail businesses combine existing store locations, road networks, and neighborhood demographic data to identify the best place to build new stores.</p>
<p>Integrating spatial with nonspatial data, such as spreadsheets or database tables, is also possible. This integration is possible if the nonspatial data has an attribute with spatial information. Many nonspatial datasets contain addresses, coordinates, or other identifiers. Combining these with spatial data allows you to unlock new insights. For example, retail businesses combine customer transaction data (containing their zip or postal code) with neighborhood demographic data to understand their customers and market their products or services more effectively.</p>
