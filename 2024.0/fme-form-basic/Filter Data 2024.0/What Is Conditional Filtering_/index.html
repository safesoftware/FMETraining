<h2 id="what-is-filtering">What is Filtering?</h2>
<p>Transformers that filter don&rsquo;t transform data content, yet they are the most commonly used type of transformer!</p>
<p>Filtering is the technique of subdividing data as it flows through a workspace. It occurs when a transformer has multiple output connections, each carrying data that needs to be processed differently. Here (for example), the incoming stream of features A is filtered into two new streams, B and C, using a transformer with two output ports:</p>

<p>A filtering transformer may be any transformer with multiple output ports, such as the GeometryFilter or Sampler transformers, the latter of which creates a sample selection of data and separates it through Sampled and NotSampled output ports:</p>

<p>However, these are mostly in-built, fixed tests. Conditional filtering is where a user-defined test or condition decides which features are output to which connection. The Tester transformer is the most obvious example of this. It carries out a test with different output ports for features that pass and fail the test.</p>
<h2 id="attribute-filtering-and-spatial-filtering">Attribute Filtering and Spatial Filtering</h2>
<p>Transformers in FME allow you to filter features in several ways. A significant distinction is between transformers that filter based on attribute values and those that filter based on spatial data. An example of attribute filtering is filtering features into two streams based on the date value stored in an attribute called LastModified. An example of spatial filtering is filtering retail locations that are within 750 meters of a transit station and those that are not.</p>
