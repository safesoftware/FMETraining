<p>Amar is a new FME user working as a GIS Technician for a city government. He just got started with the platform and has taken this FME Academy Learning Path as part of his onboarding plan. He might come back to the Academy in the future for more advanced training.</p>
<p>However, he knows the FME Community is the best place to get help using FME and learn from his peers.</p>

<p><strong>Documentation</strong></p>
<p>Now, he&rsquo;s authoring his first workspace. As he uses FME, he refers to the documentation available in FME Form via the <strong>Help&nbsp;</strong>buttons. The documentation provides technical details about each transformer and data format, making it a great first resource when authoring a workspace.</p>

<p><strong>Knowledge Base</strong></p>
<p>Amar works for a local government that uses&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cityworks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cityworks</a> for asset management and permitting. He is responsible for integrating other systems with the platform, so he checks the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.safe.com/s/knowledge-base" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knowledge Base</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a href="https://support.safe.com/s/article/tutorial-getting-started-with-cityworks-and-fme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a tutorial</a>. The Knowledge Base contains tutorials and how-to guides on specific transformers and formats.</p>
<p><strong>Forums</strong></p>
<p>As he&rsquo;s working on his Cityworks integration workspace, he runs into some challenges and wants to see how other FME users have addressed them. He goes to the&nbsp;<a href="https://community.safe.com/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FME Community Forums</a>&nbsp;and asks for help (<a href="https://community.safe.com/transformers-9/set-to-lower-case-all-attributes-that-start-with-a-given-prefix-27591" target="_blank" rel="noopener">view an example question</a>). By providing&nbsp;<a href="https://community.safe.com/guidelines-33/asking-and-answering-questions-32186" target="_blank" rel="noopener">details about his problem and a sample workspace</a>, he makes it easy for other Community members to help. It&rsquo;s not long before Amar gets guidance from his peers in the Community. They can solve his challenges together.</p>
<p><strong>Ideas Exchange</strong></p>
<p>As he&rsquo;s working more with his data, he gets some ideas for features that could improve FME Form. He goes to the <a href="https://community.safe.com/ideas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FME Community Ideas</a>&nbsp;page to suggest this as a product improvement. It turns out that other users have already suggested a related idea, so he upvotes it.</p>
<p><strong>File a Support Case</strong></p>
<p>Amar&rsquo;s workspace is almost finished, but for some reason, he gets an error when he runs it. He tries to find help on the Forum, but this time everyone is stumped. So, he conducts some troubleshooting&nbsp;<a href="https://support.safe.com/s/article/root-cause-analysis-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following this guide</a>, but he's still unable to figure out the problem. So, he&nbsp;<a href="https://support.safe.com/s/submit-case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submits a support case</a>&nbsp;and gets help from an FME expert. They identify the issue and help him fix it. Problem solved!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that he&rsquo;s used the Community to address his challenges, his workspace is finished! Amar&rsquo;s FME journey is off to a great start!</p>
