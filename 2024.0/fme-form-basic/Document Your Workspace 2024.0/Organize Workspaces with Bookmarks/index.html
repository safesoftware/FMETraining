<h2 id="why-use-bookmarks">Why Use Bookmarks?</h2>
<p>Like its real-world namesake, a bookmark is a means of putting a marker down for easy access.</p>
<p>With FME, the bookmark covers an area of the workspace that usually carries out a specific task, so a user can pick it out of a broader set of transformers and move to it with relative ease.</p>
<p>Bookmarks make your workspace more straightforward to understand and navigate.</p>
<h2 id="adding-a-bookmark">Adding a Bookmark</h2>
<p>To add a bookmark, click the Bookmark icon on the toolbar.</p>

<p>Whereas a traditional bookmark marks a single page in a book, an FME bookmark can cover a wide canvas area. You can divide a single workspace into different sections by applying multiple bookmarks.</p>
<blockquote>

<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">If you create a bookmark while objects are selected, the bookmark automatically expands to include those items.</span></p>

<h2 id="resizing-and-editing-a-bookmark">Resizing and Editing a Bookmark</h2>
<p>To resize a bookmark, hover over a corner or edge and drag the cursor to change its size or shape.</p>

<p><strong>Bookmark Properties</strong></p>
<p>Click the cogwheel icon on a bookmark header to open the bookmark properties dialog:</p>

<p>Here, you can change the bookmark's name and color and decide whether the contents will move (more on that later).</p>
<p>You can set bookmark colors to an existing color palette or use custom colors. Additionally, you can create customized palettes by going to Tools &gt; FME Options... &gt; Appearance:</p>

<p>The context (right-click) menu for a bookmark reveals options to select all objects within the bookmark or to disable all of those objects, making it useful for testing purposes:</p>
