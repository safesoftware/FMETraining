<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<p>When Jennifer first began using FME, she found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.safe.com/transformers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the list of almost 500 transformers</a> daunting. One of the most common challenges new FME users face is finding the correct transformer for a given task. However, Jennifer learns that most users only focus on the subset of transformers relevant to their day-to-day workflow. Since Jennifer doesn&rsquo;t plan on working with raster data, there is a whole category of raster-dedicated transformers that she doesn&rsquo;t need to know. She knows she doesn&rsquo;t need to be familiar with every transformer to use FME effectively.</p>
<h2 id="transformer-resources">Transformer Resources</h2>
<p>As she learned FME, Jennifer found the following resources helpful in learning about transformers:</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 2.3125em;">The Scenario</span></p>
<p>Jennifer continues to work on her workspace. The next step is to filter out records with revoked business licenses. These revoked licenses are stored in a PostgreSQL database.</p>
<p>Jennifer knows there are a few steps that need to happen to accomplish her goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read records from the database</li>
<li>Join the data to her features
<ul>
<li>Key for existing features: license_number</li>
<li>Key for database features: revoked_license</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Filter out any features with a value for revoked_license</li>
</ul>
<p>She also knows two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are many ways to accomplish your goals in FME. There are likely many transformers or combinations of transformers that can do this task. Some might be more performant than others, but the differences will be negligible with a small dataset.</li>
<li>She suspects she can find a single transformer to do it all.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="finding-a-transformer">Finding a Transformer</h2>
<p>Jennifer decides to start by looking in the Workbench<strong>&nbsp;Transformer Gallery&nbsp;</strong>categories. She sees the&nbsp;<strong>Filters and Joins </strong>category:</p>
<p><img src="images/1713287070775.png" alt="Filters and Joins category in the Workbench Transformer Gallery" width="256" height="514" /></p>
<p>She could look through the transformers here individually and read their <strong>Help </strong>pages to learn more, but she thinks that might take too long.</p>
<p>Second, she tries searching for some keywords in <strong>Quick Add</strong>. She opens her workspace and starts typing keywords. First, she tries &ldquo;filter and join,&rdquo; but this search is too specific and doesn&rsquo;t yield any attribute-related results. By default, <strong>Quick Add</strong>&nbsp;searches for transformer names only, not descriptions. She presses the&nbsp;<strong>Tab&nbsp;</strong>key to search in the&nbsp;<strong>Help&nbsp;</strong>text, which results in transformers that don&rsquo;t meet her requirements.</p>
<p>She tries some more keywords in both search modes: &ldquo;filter,&rdquo; &ldquo;merge,&rdquo; and &ldquo;join.&rdquo; These return some transformers that sound promising.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1713287389985.png" alt="Searching Quick Add" width="668" height="440" /></p>
<p>She scans the attribute transformers and their descriptions. This method produces a promising result...</p>
<p>Jennifer adds the mystery transformer <strong>Quick Add.</strong> She connects it to her workflow, sets the parameters, and finds it does just what she wants.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="https://safemytrailhead.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p>If Jennifer&rsquo;s use case had been more complex, she might have considered using the Transformer Reference Guide or posting it&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a href="https://community.safe.com/s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Community Forums</a> for help.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ve read about Jennifer&rsquo;s search for her transformer. Now you have to find it!</p>
<p>Using the techniques above and the&nbsp;<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData/Workspaces/IntegrateDataWithTheFMEPlatform/find-the-right-transformer.fmw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starting workspace</a> (in FME Workbench 2024.0 or later), find a transformer that will accomplish her goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read records from the database</li>
<li>Join the data to her features
<ul>
<li>Key for existing features: license_number</li>
<li>Key for database features: revoked_license</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Filter out any features with a value for revoked_license</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some clues:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is a<strong> single transformer </strong>that accomplishes all of the goals without requiring adding an additional reader to the workspace.
<ul>
<li>If you find a combination of transformers that work, that's fine! There's more than one way to do things with FME.</li>
<li>However, you'll need to identify the single transformer that works to answer a question in the quiz below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You do not have to add a reader to your workspace; instead, you can use a transformer that connects directly to the source data.</li>
<li>To connect to the database, you must create a <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-Form/!NamedConnections/Using_Database_Connections.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">database connection</a>.
<ul>
<li>More details below.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you find the transformer, connect it between the <strong>AttributeManager </strong>and the&nbsp;<strong>BusinessOwners </strong>writer feature type and configure it. You can use <strong>Visual Preview</strong> with feature caching to confirm the correct results. Your output will have two streams of features.</p>
<p>Features with a revoked_license:</p>
<p><img src="images/1713288275999.png" alt="Features without a revoked license" width="597" height="136" /></p>
<p>Features without one:</p>
<p><img src="images/1713288161326.png" alt="Features with a revoked license" /></p>
<p>Ensure you connect the correct stream of features to the writer feature type. Remember, we want to filter out features with revoked licenses and not write them out.</p>
