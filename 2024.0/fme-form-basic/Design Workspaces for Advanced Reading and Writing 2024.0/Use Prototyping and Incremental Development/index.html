<p>After completing this lesson, you&rsquo;ll be able to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Use workspace prototyping and incremental development to build workspaces.</li>
<li>Create simplified input data while prototyping.</li>
<li>Employ version control techniques in workspace development.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h2>
<p>In the classical sense, prototyping means creating an incomplete application to evaluate a project's feasibility.</p>
<p>Here, we'll stretch the definition to mean how to build a complex FME project incrementally, starting with an empty workspace and building it piece by piece to deliver a result that matches the final specification.</p>
<p>We will cover the techniques used for incrementally building a workspace.</p>
<h2 id="incremental-development">Incremental Development</h2>
<p>The critical development technique for FME workspaces is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incremental_build_model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">incremental updates</a>.</p>
<p>The steps to this technique are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plan your project as a series of small sections, each fitting inside a bookmark in FME.</li>
<li>Design and implement a section in FME Workbench. It should ideally be between 3-10 transformers.</li>
<li>Test each section immediately after it is completed. That way, you can identify problems early and easily because only a few changes are being made in any increment.</li>
<li>Repeat the process, saving and testing the workspace whenever you've added a new section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although a range of 3-10 transformers is an arbitrary number, the more transformers you add, the more difficult it will be to identify the source of any problems. Beyond ten transformers is the point at which you should consider chopping that process into smaller sections.</p>
<p>Here, an author has planned their workspace by laying it out as a set of bookmarks on the canvas:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1714691891890.png" alt="Bookmarks used to plan workspaces sections" width="896" height="291" /></p>
<p>Now, the author can complete and test each section simultaneously, keeping the overall goal in mind.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">It can be easy to start developing a workspace and forget to save it! FME keeps a recovery file as soon as the workspace is saved for the first time, but until then, you risk an irretrievable loss.</span></p>

<h2 id="source-data">Source Data</h2>
<p>When the FME project is large and complex, the source data will likely be large and complex, too. So, when creating a workspace in small increments and testing each part, it's better to avoid using the entire dataset. It's best to create a small sample of data - extracting it from your source and writing to a neutral format like FFS.</p>
<p>Sampling is beneficial for databases because it also avoids the problems of waiting for network traffic and database responses.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1714691902904.png" alt="Using sampling with a Tiler" width="893" height="140" /></p>
<p>Here, the workspace author extracts a sample of source data by reading from a database, splitting it into tiles, and writing just one tile to the FFS format. While prototyping a solution, the author can use this single tile to represent the entire source database table.</p>
<p>Another transformer to use would be the Sampler, although the features selected by it would not be spatially adjacent.</p>
<h2 id="version-control">Version Control</h2>
<p>It's easy to work on a single workspace file when making incremental changes to a workspace. However, there are various problems with this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faults cannot be easily tracked because there is no record of what has changed and when</li>
<li>It is not easy to create different versions for different platforms</li>
<li>If the workspace file is lost or corrupted, then the entire project is lost</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, it is better to keep versioned workspaces, where a different copy is kept for each set of revisions. This precaution can be taken manually within the file system or using a version control system like <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Git</a>.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to keep and version all materials related to an FME project, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workspace files</li>
<li>Python files</li>
<li>Log files</li>
<li>Source datasets</li>
</ul>
<p>It's better not to store any personal information, including passwords. Also, you don't need to store temporary files.</p>
<p>You can use a few methods to keep track of version and editing history:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-Form/Workbench/Compare-Workspaces.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Compare Workspaces</a> tool in FME Workbench&nbsp;</li>
<li>Use an external version control system like git</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Flow/WebUI/Version-Control.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FME Flow version control system</a></li>
<li>Include the date of the most recent edit in the filename, e.g., digital-plan-submission-2022-11-25.fmw</li>
<li>Include a version number or name in a bookmark or annotation in the workspace itself</li>
<li>Use the Overview and History <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Desktop/Workbench/workspace_parameters.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Workspace Parameters</a>&nbsp;to store workspace metadata</li>
</ul>
