<h2 id="rejected-features">Rejected Features</h2>
<p>An essential part of any workflow is handling data that fails to process, for example, when a feature with no geometry is sent into a geometry-based transformer like the AreaBuilder.</p>
<p>FME handles such failures by outputting the data through &lt;Rejected&gt; ports, which are found on many transformers:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1714691926518.png" alt="Rejected ports" width="604" height="300" /></p>
<p>A parameter exists to control the action of &lt;Rejected&gt; ports and gives the workspace author a choice over what action to take.</p>
<p>When a feature is rejected, the translation will stop, and a red circle with a number will appear on the &lt;Rejected&gt; port. You can click on the cache to inspect the feature and determine why it was rejected:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1714692188633.png" alt="A Rejected port with a feature cache" width="200" /></p>
<h2 id="rejected-feature-handling">Rejected Feature Handling</h2>
<p>The parameter to control the handling of rejected features can be found in the Navigator window under Workspace Parameters:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1714692393845.png" alt="The Rejected Feature Handling parameter in the Navigator" width="719" height="326" /></p>
<p>The two options are&nbsp;<em>Terminate Translation</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Continue Translation</em>.</p>
<p>When the parameter is set to&nbsp;<em>terminate</em>, a feature exiting via a &lt;Rejected&gt; port causes the translation to stop. To visually denote this, the &lt;Rejected&gt; ports have a small black marker:</p>
<p><img src="images/1714692535314.png" alt="Rejected port with Terminate mode enabled" width="200" /></p>
<p>The translation will continue when the parameter is set to&nbsp;continue, regardless of how many features exit &lt;Rejected&gt; ports. In that case, the small black marker is removed:</p>
<p><img src="images/1714692478638.png" alt="Rejected port with Continue mode enabled" width="186" height="158" /></p>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>terminate</em>&nbsp;mode, a rejected feature gets written to the log window with the error message:</p>
<p><code>The below feature caused the translation to be terminated</code></p>
<p>There will also be an error message relating to the transformer:</p>
<p><code>Intersector_&lt;Rejected&gt;(TeeFactory): Intersector_&lt;Rejected&gt;: Termination Message: 'Intersector output a &lt;Rejected&gt; feature.</code></p>
<p>This error is helpful because it tells the author which transformer experienced the failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="https://safemytrailhead.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">To quickly find these error messages, you can filter the Translation Log by clicking the Errors button.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="mixed-mode">Mixed Mode</h2>
<p>In&nbsp;<em>terminate</em>&nbsp;mode, a rejected feature will not cause the translation to stop, provided that the &lt;Rejected&gt; port is connected to a further object:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1714691948669.png" alt="Terminate mode with a connected Rejected port" width="462" height="220" /></p>
<p>In short, an author can create a mixed mode, where some transformers stop the translation on rejecting a feature (the Intersector above), but others will handle the feature another way (the Bufferer). That way, the author can try to handle rejected expected features but stop the translation if there are genuinely unexpected failures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="https://safemytrailhead.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Generally:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;"><em>Terminate </em>mode is helpful if you do not want any features rejected and want to verify that all your data is correct.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;"><em>Continue </em>mode is helpful if you don't care if a feature is rejected. You assume rejections happen because of incorrect data and don't want to use those r</span><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">ecords.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;"><em>Mixed </em>mode is helpful if you want to pick and choose which transformers' &lt;Rejected&gt; ports you care about.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Another important fact is that just because a feature is not rejected, does not mean the results are 100% correct! FME will only reject features based on specific problems. It doesn't know if your workspace is actually doing what you intend; that's up for you to determine.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="feature-counts-and-inspection">Feature Counts and Inspection</h2>
<p>In continue mode, features that exit a &lt;Rejected&gt; port are counted and saved for inspection:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1714692667319.png" alt="A Rejected port with a feature cache using Continue mode" width="200" height="140" /></p>
<p>FME will save features for inspection even if you do not attach a Logger or other transformer. The number tells us how many features were rejected, and the green icon can be clicked to inspect the data.</p>
<h2 id="feature-counts-and-inspection">Exercise</h2>
<ol>
<li>Open the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData/Workspaces/UseDataIntegrationBestPractices/exercise-handle-rejected-features.fmw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starting workspace</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Run it to generate feature caches.
<ol>
<li>The workspace parameter Workspace Feature Handling is set to Continue Translation so that you can see the results.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Read the annotation for each bookmark to understand what the workspace author hopes to achieve.</li>
<li>Decide if the workspace author should terminate the translation when rejected features are created for each section, if something else is going wrong, or if it is correct.</li>
<li>The quiz will ask you about your choices. There is a correct and incorrect approach here!</li>
</ol>
