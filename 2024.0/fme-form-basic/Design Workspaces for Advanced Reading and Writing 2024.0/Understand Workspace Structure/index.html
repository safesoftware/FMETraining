<h2 id="workspace-components">Workspace Components</h2>
<p>A&nbsp;<strong>workspace&nbsp;</strong>is the primary element in an FME translation and is responsible for storing a translation definition. It is the container for all the translation functionality and is stored in the following components.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Workspaces do not store the data they work with. Data is represented in the workspace as file paths, URLs, or Connections. The workspace provides FME with instructions on how to carry out the data integration workflow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">If you want to include your data in your workspace, e.g., for sharing, you can save it as a </span><a style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em; background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-Form/Workbench/templates_about.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">template</a><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">.</span></p>

<h2 id="readers-and-writers">Readers and Writers</h2>
<p>A&nbsp;<strong>reader</strong>&nbsp;is the FME term for a component in a translation that reads a source dataset. Likewise, a&nbsp;<strong>writer</strong>&nbsp;is a component that writes to a destination dataset.</p>
<p>Entries in the Navigator window represent readers and writers.</p>
<h2 id="feature-types">Feature Types</h2>
<p><strong>Feature type</strong>&nbsp;is the FME term that describes a subset of records. Common alternatives for this term are&nbsp;<em>layer</em>,&nbsp;<em>table</em>,&nbsp;<em>sheet</em>,&nbsp;<em>feature class</em>, and&nbsp;<em>object class</em>. For example, each layer in a DWG file or each table in an Oracle database is defined by a feature type in FME.</p>
<p>Feature types are represented by objects that appear on the Workbench canvas.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<p><strong>Features</strong>&nbsp;are the smallest single components of an FME translation.</p>
<p>Features can be seen in the feature counts along connection lines, as single rows or pieces of geometry in Visual Preview, and in the Feature Information Window, where you can view everything FME knows about a single feature.</p>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<p>Each workspace can contain multiple readers and writers, each of which can have multiple feature types, with multiple features. They exist in a hierarchy that looks like this:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/Img3.009.TranslationComponentsSmall.png" alt="Workspace hierarchy diagram" /></p>
<p>A workspace with multiple readers and writers might look like this:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1714691841609.png" alt="Example workspace with hierarchy annotated" width="1000" height="531" /></p>
<p>This workspace has two readers (each with three feature types) and three writers (with one, two, and one feature types). Each reader and writer has a different format, and each has a different name for its feature types.</p>
