11.0.1. Data Loading Example

In this example we will create a map using an Esri basemap and use the
Esri JavaScript functions. In this example when a box is checked the a
KML layer is loaded. When the box is unchecked then the layer will be
invisible. This is a great example of streaming real time data to a map.
While parks and skytrain stations may not be updated frequently, this
demo may be applied to real time data. For more information on the Esri
JavaScript, please refer to,
https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/intro-layers/index.html.
Please note, the repository that the workspaces are uploaded to will
have to have guest permissions. If you need to know how to do this go to Section 8.1 and see Setting Permissions.
