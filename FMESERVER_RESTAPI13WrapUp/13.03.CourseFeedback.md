Safe Software greatly values feedback from training course attendees and our feedback form is your chance to tell us what you really think about how well we’re meeting your training goals.

You can fill in **[the feedback form](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/fmetraining "FME Desktop Training Feedback Form")** now, but you'll also be reminded by email shortly after your course. Safe Software's partners who carry out training may ask that you fill in a separate form, but you can also use the official Safe Software form if you wish.
