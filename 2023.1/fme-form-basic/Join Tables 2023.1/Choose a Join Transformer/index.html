<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Several transformers can join data by matching attribute values (keys). Some are more oriented towards geometry, while others have a more SQL-like style. Some join data streams within one workspace, while others join one data stream to an external database.</p>
<p>Which you use depends on your join requirements and performance needs.</p>
<h2 id="feature-joiner">FeatureJoiner</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-Transformers/Transformers/featurejoiner.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FeatureJoiner</a> is a transformer for joining two data streams within a workspace based on a key field match. It is configured using SQL-style joins and can often be more performant than the FeatureMerger.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1644019182415.png" alt="FeatureJoiner" /></p>
<p>Here, for example, is the same Roads/Snowfall match in the FeatureJoiner. The parameters for the transformer look like this:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1644019200429.png" alt="Matching based on shared key" /></p>
<p>As you can see, this transformer is based more on traditional SQL queries. The Join Mode parameter can take one of three values:</p>
<table class="featureTable sort_table">
<thead class="thead sorted">
<tr>
<th scope="col">Mode</th>
<th scope="col">Description</th>
<th scope="col">Depiction</th>
<th scope="col">Joined Output</th>
<th scope="col">Unjoined Left</th>
<th scope="col">Unjoined Right</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody class="tbody">
<tr>
<td>Left</td>
<td>Left features look for a match and are output whether they find a match or not</td>
<td><img class="image image-block" src="images/1644019218152.png" alt="Left mode Venn diagram" /></td>
<td>All matches plus unmatched Left features</td>
<td>None</td>
<td>Unused Right features</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Inner</td>
<td>Left features look for a match and are output if they find one</td>
<td><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1644019239048.png" alt="Inner Venn diagram" /></td>
<td>All matches only</td>
<td>Unmatched Left features</td>
<td>Unused Right features</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Full</td>
<td>Both Left and Right features output through the Joined output port, whether they find a join or not</td>
<td><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1644019252877.png" alt="Full Venn diagram" /></td>
<td>All matches plus unmatched Left and Right features</td>
<td>None</td>
<td>None</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Other terms you might be familiar with are o<em>uter join</em>&nbsp;and r<em>ight join</em>. An outer join is simply a different name for what the full join does here. To do a right join, you would switch which features are being sent to which input port and use the left join option.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">The critical thing to be aware of here is that a feature is output for every match. For example, if one Road feature matches five Snowfall records, the FeatureJoiner will output five features to the Joined port.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Joined features are always output to the Joined port. Left, Inner, and Full only control which unmatched records are included in the Joined port.</span></p>
<p>With a left join, the user either believes that all roads will have a matching snowfall record, or it does not matter if there is not a match. No features will ever appear from the UnjoinedLeft output port.</p>
<p>If it was essential to ensure a match, the chosen mode should be inner. Then, records that exited the UnjoinedLeft output port could be treated as an error and investigated to determine why there was no match.</p>
<p>There are parameters to handle conflicts of information and whether to merge attributes only or geometry.</p>
<h2>FeatureMerger</h2>
<p>Another option for joining features is the <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-Transformers/Transformers/featuremerger.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FeatureMerger</a>. The FeatureMerger handles joining data differently, in that by default it only creates a single match per source feature. In FME versions 2018-2021, it tended to be slower than the FeatureJoiner in most cases. However, updates in FME 2021.1 through FME 2023.0 have narrowed the gap. The FeatureJoiner still tends to be more performant on average, especially for larger data volumes.</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li>FeatureJoiner
<ul>
<li>SQL-style join</li>
<li>Simple configuration</li>
<li>Default behavior of multiple matches per source feature</li>
<li>Rejects Null and Missing keys</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>FeatureMerger
<ul>
<li>Complex configuration</li>
<li>Default behavior of only one match per source feature</li>
<li>Option to reject Null and Missing keys or not</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="database-joiner">DatabaseJoiner</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-Transformers/Transformers/databasejoiner.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DatabaseJoiner</a> transformer differs from the FeatureJoiner because instead of merging two streams of features, it merges one (or more) stream(s) of data with records from an external database.</p>
<p>Here is the same example as the FeatureMerger above. In this case, the roads features are obtaining snowfall data directly from a table in an Excel spreadsheet:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1644019272179.png" alt="DatabaseJoiner" /></p>
<p>The parameters dialog for the DatabaseJoiner looks like this:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1644019286604.png" alt="DatabaseJoiner parameters" /></p>
<p>Again, StreetID is being used from both feature and database table to facilitate a merge between the two.</p>
<p>As with the other transformers, there are parameters to control the attributes that are accumulated and how conflicts are resolved.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img class="img mtm" role="presentation" src="images/safe_note.png" alt="Note" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">The DatabaseJoiner has a number of advantages. Firstly, it has parameters to control how multiple matches are handled, as well as parameters for optimizing the database query.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Secondly, it allows features to be joined without having to read the entire dataset into a workspace. FME can query the database and select the individual records it needs. This can improve performance significantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">It does, of course, require the supplier records to be stored in an appropriate database format!</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="inline-querier">SQLCreator, SQLExecutor, and InlineQuerier</h2>
<p>You can "let the database do the work" and see performance improvements by using SQL* transformers. For example, see <a href="https://community.safe.com/s/article/using-the-sqlexecutor-to-do-a-join" target="_self">this article</a> for an example of using the SQLExecutor to do the join with an SQL statement before reading features into FME. This method often results in faster workflows. The <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-Transformers/Transformers/sqlcreator.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SQLCreator</a> makes a single SQL query and returns the results as features. The <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-Transformers/Transformers/sqlexecutor.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SQLExecutor</a> makes one SQL query per incoming feature, similar to the FeatureReader, allowing you to make multiple queries based on the value of incoming attributes.</p>
<p>If you want to write an SQL statement to join features you have already read into your workspace, you should use the <a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME-Form-Documentation/FME-Transformers/Transformers/inlinequerier.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InlineQuerier</a> transformer. It accepts features from the workspace and generates a temporary database. With that database, it's possible to apply any SQL commands required &ndash; including joins &ndash; &nbsp;across several tables:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="images/1700608999320.png" alt="InlineQuerier SQL example" width="755" height="478" /></p>
<p>The InlineQuerier has the distinct advantage of allowing its input to be reused multiple times in a single transformer, whereas multiple joins would otherwise require multiple FeatureJoiner transformers. However, there is a performance overhead involved in generating that initial database.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">⭐ <strong>New for FME 2023.0</strong>: the InlineQuerier is </span>up to 12.9x faster and now supports <span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">spatial output queries.</span></p>
