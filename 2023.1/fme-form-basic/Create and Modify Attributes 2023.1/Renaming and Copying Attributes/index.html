<p>After completing this lesson, you'll be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rename attributes.</li>
<li>Copy attribute values to a new attribute.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Renaming and - to a lesser extent - copying attributes are also important attribute functions within FME. When you rename an attribute, it ceases to exist under its prior name; when it is copied, it exists both in its new and old names.</p>
<p>The transformers capable of renaming an attribute are:</p>

<h2 id="renaming">Renaming</h2>
<p>The purpose of renaming is to enter a new name for a selected attribute manually. The old attribute is removed and replaced with the newly named one:</p>

<p>Here, an AttributeManager renames several fields by entering a different name for the Output Attribute. The Action is automatically set to Rename. Notice that the user also enters a new constant value for the PSTLCITY/PostalCity attribute.</p>
<p>You should rename attributes so your reader schema ('what you have') matches your writer schema ('what you want').</p>

<p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;">Although you can manually type a new attribute name into the Output Attribute field, if the transformer is connected to a writer feature type with the correct attributes, its attribute names will be automatically available for selection.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="copying">Copying</h2>
<p>Depending on the transformer, copying an attribute can be one of two styles.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Desktop-Basic-2019/DesktopBasic4Transformers/Images/Img4.037.AttributeCopier.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img class="image" src="images/1699034665851.png" alt="AttributeCopier parameters" width="567" height="375" /></a></p>
<p>Here, a user configures an AttributeCopier by choosing an existing attribute and entering a new name. Again, when connected to a writer feature type, its schema is available so you can choose a matching attribute.</p>
<p>Note how both PSTLCITY and PostalCity exist on the transformer's output, proving that it is copying the attribute rather than renaming it.</p>
<p>For other transformers, the setup style is reversed: a new attribute is created and given the value of an existing attribute:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/gitbook/Desktop-Basic-2019/DesktopBasic4Transformers/Images/Img4.038.AttributeManagerCopyAttr.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img class="image" src="images/1699034903632.png" alt="AttributeManager parameters" width="516" height="176" /></a></p>
<p>In this AttributeManager transformer, the user creates a new attribute (PostalCity) and assigns it the value from another (PSTLCITY). In effect, they have made a copy of the original attribute.</p>
