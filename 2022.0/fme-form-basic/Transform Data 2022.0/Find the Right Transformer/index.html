<h2 id="the-challenge">The Challenge</h2>
<p>When Jennifer first began using FME, she found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.safe.com/transformers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the list of almost 500 transformers</a>&nbsp;a bit daunting. One of the most common challenges new FME users face is finding the right transformer for a given task. However, Jennifer learns that most users only focus on the subset of transformers that are relevant to their day-to-day workflow. Since Jennifer doesn&rsquo;t plan on working with raster data in the near future, there is a whole category of raster-dedicated transformers that she doesn&rsquo;t need to know. She knows she doesn&rsquo;t need to be familiar with every single transformer to use FME effectively.</p>
<h2 id="transformer-resources">Transformer Resources</h2>
<p>As she learned FME, Jennifer found the following resources useful for learning about transformers:</p>

<h2 id="finding-a-transformer">Finding a Transformer</h2>
<p>Jennifer needs to find a new transformer for a different workspace that retrieves today&rsquo;s weather from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.metaweather.com/api/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MetaWeather API</a>. She finds that the results of the API call (a web connection request for data located on the web) contain attributes that she doesn&rsquo;t need. From her experience, she knows it would be tedious to manually remove them with an&nbsp;<strong>AttributeManager&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>AttributeRemover</strong>. She turns to her resources to find a transformer to help her.</p>

<p>First, she tries searching for some keywords in&nbsp;<strong>Quick Add</strong>. She opens her workspace and starts typing keywords. First, she tries &ldquo;deleter,&rdquo; but this search is too specific and doesn&rsquo;t return any results related to attributes. By default,&nbsp;<strong>Quick Add</strong>&nbsp;searches for transformer names only, not descriptions. She presses the&nbsp;<strong>Tab&nbsp;</strong>key to search in the&nbsp;<strong>Help&nbsp;</strong>text, but this results in transformers that&nbsp;don&rsquo;t&nbsp;meet her requirements.</p>
<p>She tries some more keywords in both search modes: &ldquo;attribute,&rdquo; &ldquo;remover,&rdquo; &ldquo;eraser,&rdquo; &ldquo;simplifier,&rdquo; etc. Some of these searches produce useful results, but they still contain too many transformers.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/transform-data/find-the-right-transformer/images/bc-5-b-5-b-75-5565-4217-aaef-5531-f-6003119.png" alt="Searching Quick Add" /></p>
<p>Jennifer decides to look in the&nbsp;Workbench<strong>&nbsp;Transformer Gallery&nbsp;</strong>categories. She sees the&nbsp;<strong>Attribute&nbsp;</strong>category, but it still has a lot of transformers in it. Again, she could look through this list and read the&nbsp;<strong>Help&nbsp;</strong>text, but it could take a while to find what she is looking for.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/transform-data/find-the-right-transformer/images/742-b-5194-e-727-49-db-a-720-a-7-e-90027-b-8-d-9.png" alt="Attributes category in the Transformer Gallery" /></p>
<p>Jennifer now turns to the&nbsp;<a href="http://safe.com/transformers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>online</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Transformer Gallery</strong></a>. Here she restricts the category to&nbsp;<strong>Attributes</strong>. With the default&nbsp;<strong>Sort By</strong>&nbsp;set to &ldquo;Most Used&rdquo;, she scans the top attribute transformers and their descriptions. This method produces a promising result: the&nbsp;<strong>AttributeKeeper</strong>, one of the most-used attribute transformers! Its description reads, &ldquo;Removes all attributes and list attributes, except the specific ones you specify to be retained.&rdquo; That sounds like it should work.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/transform-data/find-the-right-transformer/images/a-50-a-4-f-2-e-30-bc-46-ff-89-fc-bafbc-9305-ac-3.png" alt="Browsing the Attributes category in the Online Transformer Gallery" /></p>
<p>Jennifer goes back to FME Workbench and adds an&nbsp;<strong>AttributeKeeper&nbsp;</strong>using&nbsp;<strong>Quick Add.</strong>&nbsp;She connects it to her workflow, sets the parameters, and finds it does just what she wanted. She can choose a few attributes she wants to keep and remove the rest.</p>
<p>If Jennifer&rsquo;s use case was more complex, she might have considered using the&nbsp;<a href="https://cdn.safe.com/resources/fme/FME-Transformer-Reference-Guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transformer Reference Guide</a>&nbsp;or posting on the&nbsp;<a href="http://knowledge.safe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Community Forums</a>&nbsp;for help.</p>

<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>You&rsquo;ve read about Jennifer&rsquo;s search for the&nbsp;<strong>AttributeKeeper</strong>. Now it&rsquo;s your turn!</p>
<p>Using the techniques above and the&nbsp;<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData/Workspaces/IntegrateDataWithTheFMEPlatform/find-the-right-transformer.fmw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starting workspace</a>&nbsp;(in FME Workbench 2022.0 or later), try to find a transformer that will order your features in ascending alphabetical order by &ldquo;last_name&rdquo;. Once you find it, connect it between the&nbsp;<strong>GeometryFilter</strong>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<strong>BusinessOwners&nbsp;</strong>feature type and use it to order your features. You can use&nbsp;<strong>Visual Preview</strong>&nbsp;with feature caching to confirm the features are in the right order. Your output should look like this:</p>
