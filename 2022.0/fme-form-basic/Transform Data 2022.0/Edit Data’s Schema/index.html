<h2 id="view-source-schema">View Source Schema</h2>
<p>Jennifer is continuing to work on her&nbsp;<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData/Workspaces/IntegrateDataWithTheFMEPlatform/edit-your-datas-schema.fmw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workspace</a>&nbsp;in FME Workbench (2022.0 or later). This workspace creates an Esri geodatabase from a PostGIS layer. Jennifer would like her geodatabase to have a different&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.safe.com/fme/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_Desktop/Workbench/Understanding_Schema.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">schema</a>&nbsp;than her source PostGIS data. She&rsquo;d like to make the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change some attributes so they make more sense to the public:
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;first&rdquo; renamed to &ldquo;first_name&rdquo; to match &ldquo;last_name&rdquo;</li>
<li>Move &ldquo;last_name&rdquo; to be the first column and sort it alphabetically, matching common conventions when working with names</li>
<li>Remove &ldquo;latitude&rdquo; and &ldquo;longitude&rdquo; attributes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rename feature types to better reflect what they contain:
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;public_BusinessOwners_point&rdquo; to &ldquo;BusinessOwners&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;public_BusinessOwners_geom&rdquo; to &ldquo;BusinessOwners_incomplete&rdquo;. This feature type should contain any features missing geometry so the Quality Assurance team can fix them by adding geometry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Remove empty feature types:
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;public_BusinessOwners_line&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;public_BusinessOwners_polygon&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Manipulating schema (the formal definition of a dataset&rsquo;s structure) is a key process in FME. When creating an FME workspace that modifies schema, there are generally two steps:</p>
<p><strong>1. Edit the schema</strong>: define what schema you want on the written data. In FME, this is done by changing the feature type parameters to reflect what you want, e.g. changing attribute or feature type names.</p>
<p><strong>2. Map the schema</strong>: define the relationship between the source schema (what you have) and the destination schema (what you want). In FME this is accomplished by using transformers to define how the old and new schema are related.</p>

<p><strong>Generate Workspace</strong>&nbsp;has created a duplicate of the reader schema on the writer schema in Jennifer&rsquo;s workspace. Now she has to edit the schema to get the results she wants. The first step is to view the writer schema. She does that by double-clicking on the&nbsp;<strong>public_BusinessOwners_point&nbsp;</strong>feature type to open its dialog.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/transform-data/edit-datas-schema/images/1652132329371.png" alt="double-clicking on the public_BusinessOwners_point feature type to open its dialog" /></p>
<p>The writer&nbsp;<strong>Feature Type&nbsp;</strong>dialog contains all of the data&rsquo;s schema information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Feature type name (in this case,&nbsp;<strong>Feature Class or Table Name</strong>, but it varies by format)</li>
<li>Allowed geometries (if any, in this case under&nbsp;<strong>Geometry</strong>)</li>
<li>Attribute names (in the&nbsp;<strong>User Attributes t</strong>ab under the&nbsp;<strong>Name&nbsp;</strong>column)
<ul>
<li>They are now all lowercase, matching PostGIS specifications</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attribute data types (in the&nbsp;<strong>User Attributes</strong>&nbsp;tab under the&nbsp;<strong>Type&nbsp;</strong>column)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="rename-output">Rename Output</h2>
<p>Jennifer wants to rename the&nbsp;feature types&nbsp;to &ldquo;BusinessOwners&rdquo; and &ldquo;BusinessOwners_incomplete&rdquo; to distinguish features with and without geometry. She does this by renaming<strong>&nbsp;Feature Class or Table Name</strong>&nbsp;to &ldquo;BusinessOwners&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/transform-data/edit-datas-schema/images/d-45795-ec-5-fcb-430-d-b-295-1377-cbcd-1-e-34.png" alt="Editing writer feature type name" /></p>
<p>After changing the text, she clicks&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>. The name of the feature type is updated on the canvas.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/transform-data/edit-datas-schema/images/1652132370074.png" alt="The feature type name changes" /></p>
<p>Jennifer can see some of her data is missing geometry. She can tell because the&nbsp;<strong>GeometryFilter&nbsp;</strong>has results coming out of the&nbsp;<strong>Null&nbsp;</strong>port, which means that those features are neither points, lines, or polygons.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/transform-data/edit-datas-schema/images/1652132400739.png" alt="Null feature types" />She wants to route the features missing geometry to their own feature class so the Quality Assurance team can fix them. Therefore, she renames the<strong>&nbsp;public_BusinessOwners_geom</strong>&nbsp;feature type to &ldquo;BusinessOwners_incomplete&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/transform-data/edit-datas-schema/images/1652132451879.png" alt="Null feature type renamed" /></p>
<p>Now when the geodatabase is written, it will have these names for its feature classes.</p>

<p>In some cases, the name of a feature type will be the same name of the file created. In other cases, such as with files that have multiple tables or layers, the feature type will indicate the name of the table or layer, not the file. The first parameter in all writer feature type dialogs indicates what will be created, e.g.&nbsp;<strong>Feature Class or Table Name</strong>&nbsp;for geodatabases or&nbsp;<strong>Sheet Name&nbsp;</strong>for Excel. You can set the output file or folder name in the first parameter under the writer in the&nbsp;<strong>Navigator</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="remove-empty-writer-feature-types">Remove Empty Writer Feature Types</h2>
<p>Jennifer takes a look at the feature counts along the connection lines coming out of the&nbsp;<strong>GeometryFilter</strong>. She notices there are no features coming out of the&nbsp;<strong>Line</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Area</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Surface</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Collection</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>&lt;Unfiltered&gt;</strong>&nbsp;ports. That means there are only point and null geometries in the source data. It is therefore unnecessary to handle features from the&nbsp;<strong>Line</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Area</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Surface&nbsp;</strong>output ports, as FME won&rsquo;t create empty feature classes. Since nothing is being written to these feature types, she deletes the&nbsp;<strong>public_BusinessOwners_line&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>public_BusinessOwners_polygon</strong>&nbsp;feature types by right-clicking them and selecting&nbsp;<strong>Delete</strong>. Now her workspace looks like this:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/transform-data/edit-datas-schema/images/cf-6-bdd-87-7211-40-f-1-8399-fbcdadaee-602.png" alt="Deleting unneeded feature types" /></p>
<h2 id="edit-writer-feature-type-attributes">Edit Writer Feature Type Attributes</h2>
<p>Now that Jennifer has edited the feature type names, she would also like to change the attributes. She double-clicks the&nbsp;<strong>BusinessOwners&nbsp;</strong>feature type to open the dialog. She clicks on the<strong> User Attributes </strong>tab to view the attributes she wants to edit.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/transform-data/edit-datas-schema/images/c-54-bd-0-a-4-d-63-e-4913-907-d-5-f-2829-c-2-b-602.png" alt="User Attributes tab" /></p>
<p>The table listing them can be edited. She can rename them, change their type, reorder them, or add a new attribute. She renames &ldquo;first&rdquo; to &ldquo;first_name&rdquo; by typing in the&nbsp;<strong>Name&nbsp;</strong>cell of the table.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/transform-data/edit-datas-schema/images/34-fe-2671-258-b-442-b-8-e-76-27-a-4-f-4-f-2-b-3-c-4.png" alt="Editing attribute name" /></p>
<p>She also changes the order of the attributes, clicking on a row to select it and then using the up and down triangle buttons at the bottom of the table to change their order. She uses the&nbsp;<strong>Move Down</strong>&nbsp;button to move &ldquo;first_name&rdquo; down one spot so it comes after &ldquo;last_name&rdquo;.&nbsp;<img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/transform-data/edit-datas-schema/images/1-c-279426-f-250-4-a-34-9-fb-0-b-813926-da-374.png" alt="Changing attribute order" /></p>
<p>Jennifer no longer wants the latitude and longitude attributes written to her feature class, so she deletes those attributes from the User Attributes tab of the writer feature type dialog. She selects their rows and clicks the<strong>&nbsp;Remove Row</strong>&nbsp;button.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/transform-data/edit-datas-schema/images/c-25-f-6-bdf-a-2-fd-4-bf-5-8-b-27-b-0-e-059180-d-1-f.png" alt="Removing attributes" /></p>
<p>She clicks&nbsp;<strong>OK&nbsp;</strong>to exit the dialog and apply the changes.</p>
<h2 id="view-data-with-edited-schema">View Data with Edited Schema</h2>
<p>Jennifer wants to preview her data with the edited schema. She clicks&nbsp;<strong>Run&nbsp;</strong>and once the workspace is finished, she clicks her&nbsp;<strong>BusinessOwners</strong>&nbsp;feature type once to select it and then clicks<strong>&nbsp;View Written Data</strong>.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/transform-data/edit-datas-schema/images/194-af-7-ed-111-e-440-a-bf-35-83673426019-d.png" alt="View Written Data" /></p>
<p>The data appears in<strong>&nbsp;Visual Preview</strong>. She can see in<strong>&nbsp;Table View</strong>&nbsp;that the schema has been edited, but some of the data is missing. For example, &ldquo;last_name&rdquo; is in the correct position, but &ldquo;first_name&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t have any values.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/transform-data/edit-datas-schema/images/888-e-8-ac-9-17-b-2-4568-bb-09-4295-ca-084-ef-5.png" alt="Table View with edited attributes" /></p>
<p>In order to provide the right values to the written data, Jennifer has to&nbsp;map her schema, connecting the source and destination schema.</p>
