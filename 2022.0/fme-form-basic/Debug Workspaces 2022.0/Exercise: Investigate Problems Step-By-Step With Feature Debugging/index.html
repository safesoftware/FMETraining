<h2 id="feature-debugging">Feature Debugging</h2>
<p>Feature Debugging is a tool that allows you to inspect individual features during a translation. It differs from inspecting data at a particular location in that it inspects features one at a time and enables the author to trace that feature's progress through a workspace.</p>
<p>This tool is most useful when you have identified a problem occurring during transformation, but the point of failure is unknown.</p>
<p>Feature Debugging is triggered by "breakpoints," workspace connections that the user flags as a location where they wish to inspect features:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/debug-workspaces/exercise-investigate-problems-step-by-step-with-feature-debugging/images/601-e-4-bb-9-0-fe-8-4837-903-e-005-ca-3-f-2-ccdd.png" alt="Adding a Breakpoint" width="622" height="312" /></p>
<p>The connection is highlighted in a darker black color with a red "stop" sign to denote its new status:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/debug-workspaces/exercise-investigate-problems-step-by-step-with-feature-debugging/images/71-eac-1-af-b-4-eb-43-eb-b-90-e-682221006-b-93.png" alt="Viewing an added breakpoint" width="253" height="206" /></p>
<p>Now enable Run &gt; Stop at Breakpoints and then run the translation:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/debug-workspaces/exercise-investigate-problems-step-by-step-with-feature-debugging/images/802-bb-001-0-ced-49-f-1-90-df-28-f-9-a-9-e-01-bc-3.png" alt="Enabling Stop at Breakpoints" width="305" height="198" /></p>
<p>When the first feature arrives at the breakpoint, FME temporarily pauses the translation and displays information about the feature in a Feature Inspector window.</p>
<p>The upper section of the window shows a graphic representation of the feature; the lower section lists properties such as Feature Type and Coordinate System, plus attribute and geometry information.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/debug-workspaces/exercise-investigate-problems-step-by-step-with-feature-debugging/images/d-70-f-669-c-f-145-41-e-1-a-80-f-ee-95-a-40-bf-98-e.png" alt="Viewing a feature in the Feature Inspector with Stop At Breakpoints enabled" width="441" height="564" /></p>
<p>There are four buttons at the foot of the Feature Inspector window:</p>

<h2 id="exercise">Exercise</h2>
<p>Open the&nbsp;<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/FMEData/FMEData/Workspaces/UseDataIntegrationBestPractices/exercise-investigate-problems-step-by-step-with-feature-debugging.fmw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starting workspace</a>&nbsp;in FME Workbench (2022.0 or later). Right-click the connection line directly after the PostalAddress feature type and click Add Breakpoint.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/debug-workspaces/exercise-investigate-problems-step-by-step-with-feature-debugging/images/86-f-6-a-428-51-c-5-4903-adf-8-95-e-8-eef-4-d-117.png" alt="Adding a Breakpoint" width="624" height="321" /></p>
<p>Click the Run menu &gt; Stop at Breakpoints, then click Run.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/debug-workspaces/exercise-investigate-problems-step-by-step-with-feature-debugging/images/3-cebd-382-6-d-0-d-4862-b-626-3-f-7-a-548093-de.png" alt="Enabling Stop at Breakpoints" width="304" height="215" /></p>
<p>The PostalAddress reader starts to read in features but hits the breakpoint and stops. You can inspect the first address in the Feature Inspector window. It doesn&rsquo;t have any geometry, but you can inspect its attributes.</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/debug-workspaces/exercise-investigate-problems-step-by-step-with-feature-debugging/images/1-cbe-8476-0135-481-b-b-757-ed-7-a-7-d-280-a-61.png" alt="Viewing the added Breakpoint after reading a single feature" width="457" height="101" /></p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/debug-workspaces/exercise-investigate-problems-step-by-step-with-feature-debugging/images/2-befd-963-eccc-43-b-3-bce-8-a-17-bb-4238945.png" alt="Viewing the first feature" width="449" height="381" />&nbsp;Click the Step to next connection button.</p>

<p>Your view of the canvas will shift over to the Creator transformer as it creates its first feature. Click the Step to next connection button again. The FeatureReader reads one feature and the Feature Inspector window displays it:</p>
<p><img class="image image-block image-center" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/safemytrailhead/modules/debug-workspaces/exercise-investigate-problems-step-by-step-with-feature-debugging/images/1617223378720.png" alt="Viewing a noise control area feature in Feature Inspector" /></p>
<p>Click the Step to next connection button several more times to read in the three noise control areas. Eventually, your view will go back to the address feature and follow it through connections. Eventually, the address features will stop at a particular transformer and the active connection will go back to reading more addresses. Please pay attention to where they stop. You will need the answer for this lesson&rsquo;s quiz!</p>

<p>Although it&rsquo;s not necessarily required in this workspace, being able to read in a single feature at a time can help you debug. Note how this method lets you observe the order data is read and processed in a way that is difficult to do when the entire workspace is running.</p>
