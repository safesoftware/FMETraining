<h2 id="who-are-fme-users">Who Are FME Users?</h2>
<p>People use FME for a variety of reasons. Most of our users fall into one or more of the&nbsp;following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GIS Technicians</strong>:&nbsp;professionals with a background in geography who work entry-level positions in GIS. Their day-to-day tasks include conducting spatial analysis, loading data in and out of GIS databases, and creating maps or GIS applications.</li>
<li><strong>GIS Experts</strong>: mid- or late-career professionals with a background in geography, computer science, or engineering who are highly advanced GIS users working on big cross-departmental projects. They often design the systems GIS Technicians implement and end up working with a wider variety of data types and applications.</li>
<li><strong>Business Data Analysts</strong>:&nbsp;professionals&nbsp;with a background in business analytics who normally work in programs like&nbsp;Excel&nbsp;and&nbsp;business intelligence&nbsp;tools like Qlik, Tableau, or PowerBI. They find value from FME because their data has gotten too big and complex to manage in spreadsheets, and they want to automate the data preparation process.</li>
<li><strong>Citizen Integrators</strong>: professionals with various backgrounds working with data who are trying to reduce their data integration costs and automate everyday tasks. Their solutions are tactical, and they value FME for being able to integrate data and applications quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Integration Specialists</strong>: professionals creating data and application integration&nbsp;solutions&nbsp;at an enterprise level. They often work in an IT department or are a consultant. Their solutions are strategic, and they value FME for creating durable and comprehensive integrations.</li>
</ul>
