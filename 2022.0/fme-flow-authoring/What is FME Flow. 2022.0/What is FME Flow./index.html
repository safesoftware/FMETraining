<p>FME Server is a powerful product for handling large volumes of data at the enterprise level. It has three core capabilities: self-serve, real-time, and automation.</p>
<h2 id="self-serve">Self-Serve</h2>
<p>Self-serve is the ability for the end-user to select and download the data they require, in the format and structure they require, or to upload data for processing. It eliminates the need for a data manager/analyst to carry out manual data distribution tasks.</p>
<h2 id="real-time">Real-Time</h2>
<p>Real-time is the ability to react to real-time events and sensors, carry out immediate updates, and deliver instant notifications. It allows subscribers to have the most up-to-date information for their business decision-making.</p>
<h2 id="automation">Automation</h2>
<p>Automation is the ability to carry out data processing on a specific schedule and to spontaneously move data through different systems and web services &ndash; even onto mobile platforms and devices. It allows data to move from anywhere, to anywhere, without manual intervention.</p>

<h2 id="fme-server-vs-fme-desktop">FME Server vs. FME Desktop</h2>
<p>FME Server expands on the local processing tools of FME Desktop by providing the same core data translations and transformations, but at an enterprise level, and with the above enterprise-level capabilities.</p>
<p>With these capabilities, FME Server can take advantage of a huge variety of different communication technologies. This means it can provide many different ways to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a workspace.</li>
<li>Structure a translation.</li>
<li>Deliver the output.</li>
</ul>
<p>FME Server has limited editing capabilities (changing services and modifying published parameters), but cannot create workspaces, so FME Desktop is used to create and edit workspaces.</p>
<p>The focus of this Learning Path is how to create these workspaces in ways that will take full advantage of FME Server&rsquo;s enterprise capabilities.</p>
