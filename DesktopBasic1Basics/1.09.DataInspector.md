## FME Data Inspector ##

FME Data Inspector is a standalone application for inspecting data.

### Starting FME Data Inspector ###

To start the Data Inspector, locate it in the Windows start menu:

### Major Components of FME Data Inspector ###

When FME Data Inspector opens a dataset, it looks something like this:

These components function the same as Visual Preview, with the following differences:
- There is a menu bar.
- The Graphics window is called the View window and can have multiple tabs called Views, each displaying different datasets.
- You can open data (File > Open Dataset), which opens it in a new View, or you can add data (File > Add Dataset), which adds data to the open View.
- A few additional tools are available, including [Mark Location](http://docs.safe.com/fme/2019.0/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_DataInspector/DataInspector/Marking-Locations.htm) and [Measure Distances](http://docs.safe.com/fme/2019.0/html/FME_Desktop_Documentation/FME_DataInspector/DataInspector/Using_the_Measuring_Tool.htm).

## Viewing Data ##
The FME Data Inspector provides two methods for viewing data: opening or adding.

***Opening*** a dataset opens a new view window for it to be displayed in. ***Adding*** a dataset displays the data in the existing view window; this way multiple datasets can be viewed simultaneously.

### Opening a Dataset ###
Datasets can be opened in the FME Data Inspector in several ways.

- Select File > Open Dataset from the menu bar
- Select the toolbar button Open Dataset.
- Drag and drop a file onto any window (except the View window)
- Open from within Workbench

Opening data from within FME Workbench is achieved by simply right-clicking on a canvas feature type (either source or destination) and choosing the option ‘Inspect.'

All of these methods cause a dialog to open in the FME Data Inspector in which to define the dataset to view.

### Adding a Dataset ###
Opening a dataset causes a new View tab to be created and the data displayed. To open a dataset within an existing view tab requires the use of tools to add a dataset.

- Selecting File > Add Dataset from the menu bar
- Selecting the toolbar button Add Dataset
- Dragging and Dropping a file onto the view window

### Windowing Tools ###
Once data has been opened in the FME Data Inspector, there are many tools available for altering the view.

- Pan
- Zoom In
- Zoom Out
- Zoom to a selected feature
- Zoom to the full extent of the data

This functionality allows users to quickly move between query and navigation modes at the press of a key, so there's no need to click between query and navigation tools on the menu bar or toolbar.
