# Window Control #
All windows in Workbench can be detached from their default position and deposited in a custom location. To do this simply click on the frame of the window and drag it into a new position.

<br>If a window is dropped on top of an existing window, then the two will become **tabbed**.

If a window is dropped beside an existing window (or between two existing windows), then they will become **stacked**.

In the above screenshot, the user is dropping the Navigator into position on the left-hand side of Workbench, stacked on top of the Parameter Editor.
