# Lab Exercises

In this section of the modules, students will complete independent exercises using FME Workbench and FME Data Inspector. It is designed for students to complete in a lab with instructor supervision or on their own time as an assignment.

# Structure

The exercise section is made up of four sections. These sections are:

- Getting Started with FME Desktop
- Data Transformation
- Data Integration Scenario
- Lab Questions

The first section covers the basic functionality of FME Desktop. The second explores data transformation, including both structural and content transformation. The third section presents a real-world scenario requiring data integration. The fourth and final section contains **16** questions for grading. Refer to these as you complete the exercises.
