<p><em>A game of battleship. If I were to guess the coordinates B1, I would get a Hit, marked in green. If I said the Coordinates E6 (red), I would miss.

<p>Have you ever played <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Battleship</a>? It&rsquo;s a classic game that utilizes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cartesian coordinate system</a>&nbsp;as a part of its mechanics.</p>
<p>Built on a grid system with letters representing a location on the horizontal axis and numbers a location on the vertical axis, the game involves somewhat futile guessing using a combination of a letter and a number to mark a specific location on the grid. You would hope to &ldquo;hit&rdquo; your opponent&rsquo;s hidden ship at this specific location.</p>
<p>This location is a coordinate:&nbsp;<strong>a specific point on a line, scale, or surface</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://fme.safe.com/blog/2009/12/3-key-concepts-in-coordinates-and-mapping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">When it comes to maps</a>, coordinates are numeric values used to represent specific points on the Earth. These are often communicated in pairs &mdash; a horizontal X value and a vertical Y value like 49.178010&deg;, -122.842655&deg; (aka.&nbsp;<a href="https://fme.safe.com/blog/2009/03/axis-order-in-spatial-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latitude and longitude</a>).</p>
<p>Coordinates are an instrumental piece of data in a variety of industries. Surveyors need to know <a href="https://fme.safe.com/fme-in-action/customers/auckland-council-locus-enhance-property-record-accuracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the exact points on the Earth at which to build</a>, utilities need to be able to&nbsp;<a href="https://fme.safe.com/fme-in-action/customers/city-of-burnaby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">place networks in specific locations underground</a> where they won&rsquo;t be disturbed, and telecommunication services need to know precisely <a href="https://fme.safe.com/fme-in-action/customers/telecom-spatial-intel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">where to place service towers</a>&nbsp;to support their clients. Without coordinates, life would be pretty chaotic (uncoordinated, one could say).</p>
<p>However, without any context or rules, these are just numbers. They could be anywhere or mean anything! It&rsquo;s like they lack some system to define them!</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-coordinate-system">What is a Coordinate System?</h2>
<p>English, a sometimes nonsensical language, also allows you to use the word coordinate as a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/coordinate" target="_self">verb defined</a> as &ldquo;to bring into a common action, movement, or condition.&rdquo; Conveniently, a coordinate system does just this.</p>
<p><strong>A coordinate system defines a standard set of conditions or rules that apply to all its coordinates</strong>. You could say, "A c<em>oordinate system systematically coordinates coordinates</em>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not always straightforward. The Earth is a complex shape, not a smooth and perfect sphere, as I experienced with the classroom globe. It&rsquo;s more like a lump of playdough shaped into a ball by a toddler's tiny, clumsy fingers. Mountains, valleys, plains, fjords, canyons, and so much water. To top it off, it&rsquo;s not static. The moon's gravity acts on the oceans, tectonic plates continue their slo-mo movements of nudging continents around, and even the poles shift.</p>
<p>So you can imagine, when people looked at this problem of locating places on the crazy-shaped, always-changing Earth, they had a lot of different things to consider. Some looked at specific regions, like a province, while others created systems&nbsp;oriented around tidal levels. Others ignored both of these things and chose something else entirely.</p>
<p>This is why we have thousands of&nbsp;<em>geographic coordinate systems</em>&mdash;there are many right answers depending on what you need. There is no single perfect coordinate system that is appropriate for all use cases.</p>
<p>These thousands of coordinate systems can co-exist because they are each defined by a standard set of rules or properties. At a high level, geographic coordinate systems all have:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A datum</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; remember, the Earth is a playdough sphere.&nbsp;<a href="https://fme.safe.com/blog/2010/01/datums-in-gis-coping-with-the-limits-of-latlong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A datum</a> is the mathematical frame of reference that approximates the 3D shape of the Earth for measurement. This can be a perfect sphere like a classroom globe or ellipsoidal and flattened and is often shifted off the Earth's center of mass to provide more accurate measurements.</li>
<li><strong>Angular units</strong> &ndash; The measurement used to describe the angle of a point on the Earth&rsquo;s surface about the center of the Earth. The most common angular units used are decimal degrees (DD), degree minutes seconds (DMS), and decimal minutes (DM).</li>
<li><strong>Prime Meridian</strong> &ndash; the north-south line along the Earth&rsquo;s surface indicates 0&deg; longitude. The most commonly used prime meridian runs through Greenwich, England.</li>
</ul>
<p>These standardized models of points on the earth are key for ensuring accurate spatial data.</p>
