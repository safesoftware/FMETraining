With over five hundred (500) transformers, FME possesses a lot of functionality; probably a lot more than a new user realizes and much of which would be very useful to them. This section helps you find the transformer you need, even if you didn’t realize you needed it.

Although the transformer list can look a bit overwhelming, don't panic! The reality is that most users focus on 20-30 transformers that are relevant to their day-to-day workflow. You don't need to know every single transformer to use FME effectively.
